'''For people working with dzVents prior to version 2.0: Please read the [[#Change_log|change log]] below as there are a couple of (easy-to-fix) breaking changes. Or check [[#Migrating_from_version_1.x.x|Migrating from version 1.x.x]]'''

= About dzVents 2.3.0 =

dzVents (|diː ziː vɛnts| short for Domoticz Easy Events) brings Lua scripting in Domoticz to a whole new level. Writing scripts for Domoticz has never been so easy. Not only can you define triggers more easily, and have full control over timer-based scripts with extensive scheduling support, dzVents presents you with an easy to use API to all necessary information in Domoticz. No longer do you have to combine all kinds of information given to you by Domoticzs in many different data tables. You don't have to construct complex commandArrays anymore. dzVents encapsulates all the Domoticz peculiarities regarding controlling and querying your devices. And on top of that, script performance has increased a lot if you have many scripts because Domoticz will fetch all device information only once for all your device scripts and timer scripts.

Let's start with an example. Let's say you have a switch that when activated, it should activate another switch but only if the room temperature is above a certain level. And when done, it should send a notification. This is how it looks like in dzVents:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        devices = {
            'Room switch'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, roomSwitch)
        if (roomSwitch.state == 'On' and domoticz.devices('Living room').temperature &gt; 18) then
            domoticz.devices('Another switch').switchOn()
            domoticz.notify('This rocks!',
                            'Turns out that it is getting warm here',
                            domoticz.PRIORITY_LOW)
        end
    end
}</pre>
Or you have a timer script that should be executed every 10 minutes but only on weekdays and have it do something with some user variables and only during daytime:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        timer = {'Every 10 minutes on mon,tue,wed,thu,fri'}
    },
    execute = function(domoticz)
        -- check time of the day
        if (domoticz.time.isDayTime and domoticz.variables('myVar').value == 10) then
            domoticz.variables('anotherVar').set(15)
            --activate my scene
            domoticz.setScene('Evening lights', 'On')
            if (domoticz.devices('My PIR').lastUpdate.minutesAgo &gt; 5) then
                domoticz.devices('Bathroom lights').switchOff()
            end
        end
    end
}</pre>
Or you want to detect a humidity rise within the past 5 minutes:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        timer = {'every 5 minutes'}
    },
    data = {
        previousHumidity = { initial = 100 }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz)
        local bathroomSensor = domoticz.devices('BathroomSensor')
        if (bathroomSensor.humidity - domoticz.data.previousHumidity) &gt;= 5) then
            -- there was a significant rise
            domoticz.devices('Ventilator').switchOn()
        end
        -- store current value for next cycle
        domoticz.data.previousHumidity = bathroomSensor.humidity
    end
}</pre>
Just to give you an idea! Everything in your Domoticz system is now logically available in the domoticz object structure. With this domoticz object you can get to all the information in your system and manipulate your devices.

= Using dzVents with Domoticz =

In Domoticz go to '''Setup &gt; Settings &gt; Other''' and in the section EventSystem make sure the checkbox 'dzVents disabled' is not checked. Also make sure that in the Security section in the settings you allow <code>127.0.0.1</code> to not need a password. dzVents uses that port to send certain commands to Domoticz. Finally make sure you have set your current location in '''Setup &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Location''' otherwise there is no way to determine nighttime/daytime state.

There are two ways of creating dzVents event script in Domoticz:

# By creating lua scripts in your domoticz instance on your domoticz server: <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/scripts</code>. Make sure that each script has the extension <code>.lua</code> and follows the guidelines as described below.
# By creating lua scripts inside Domoticz using the internal Domoticz event editor: Go to '''Setup &gt; More Options &gt; Events''' and set the event type to Lua (dzVents).

'''Note: scripts that you write on the filesystem and inside Domoticz using the internal web-editor all share the same namespace. That means that if you have two scripts with the same name, only the one of the filesystem will be used. The log will tell you when this happens.'''

== Quickstart ==

If you made sure that dzVents system is active we can do a quick test if everything works:

<ul>
<li>Pick a switch in your Domoticz system. Write down the exact name of the switch. If you don't have a switch then you can create a Dummy switch and use that one.</li>
<li>Create a new file in the <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/scripts/</code> folder (or using the web-editor in Domoticz, swtich to dzVents mode first.). Call the file <code>test.lua</code>. ''Note: when you create a script in the web-editor you do '''not''' add the .lua extension!''</li>
<li><p>Open <code>test.lua</code> in an editor and fill it with this code and change <code>&lt;exact name of the switch&gt;</code> with the .. you guessed it... exact name of the switch device:</p>
<pre> return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        devices = {
            '&lt;exact name of the switch&gt;'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, switch)
        if (switch.state == 'On') then
            domoticz.log('Hey! I am on!')
        else
            domoticz.log('Hey! I am off!')
        end
    end
}</pre></li>
<li>Save the script</li>
<li>Open the Domoticz log in the browser</li>
<li>In Domoticz GUI (perhaps in another browser tab) press the switch.</li>
<li><p>You can watch the log in Domoticz and it should show you that indeed it triggered your script and you should see the log messages.</p></li></ul>

See the examples folder <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/examples</code> for more examples.

= Writing scripts =

In order for your scripts to work with dzVents, they have to be turned into a Lua module. Basically you make sure it returns a Lua table (object) with a couple of predefined keys like <code>active</code>, <code>on</code> and <code>execute</code>.. Here is an example:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        devices = {
            'My switch'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, device)
        -- your script logic goes here, something like this:

        if (device.state == 'On') then
            domoticz.notify('I am on!', '', domoticz.PRIORITY_LOW)
        end
    end
}</pre>
Simply said, if you want to turn your existing script into a script that can be used with dzVents, you put it inside the execute function.

So, the module returns a table with these sections (keys):

<pre>return {
    active = ... ,
    on = {
        devices = { ... },
        variables = { ... },
        timer = { ... },
        security = { ... }
    },
    data = { ... },
    execute = function(domoticz, device, triggerInfo)
        ...
    end
}</pre>
== Sections in the script ==

As you can see in the example above, the script has a couple of sections necessary for the script to do when and what you want:

=== active = true/false (optional) ===

If the active-setting is false then the script is not activated. dzVents will ignore the file completely. If you don't have an active specified, true is assumed. This is handy if you write scripts using Domoticz' internal script editor as this one has its own way of activating and deactivating scripts.

The active setting can either be:

* '''true''': the script file will be processed.
* '''false''': the script file is ignored.
* '''function''': A function returning <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The function will receive the domoticz object with all the information about you domoticz instance: <code>active = function(domoticz) .... end</code>. So for example you could check for a Domoticz variable or switch and prevent the script from being executed. '''However, be aware that for ''every script'' in your scripts folder, this active function will be called, every cycle!! So, it is better to put all your logic in the execute function instead of in the active function.'''

=== on = { ... } ===

The on-section holds all the events/triggers that are monitored by dzVents. If any of the events or triggers matches with the current event coming from Domoticz then the <code>execute</code> part of the script is executed. The on-section has five kinds of subsections that ''can all be used simultaneously!'' :

* '''devices = { ...}''': this is a list of devices. Each device can be:
** The name of your device between string quotes. '''You can use the asterisk (*) wild-card here e.g. <code>PIR_*</code> or <code>*_PIR</code>'''. E.g.: <code>devices = { 'myDevice', 'anotherDevice', 123, 'pir*' }</code>
** The index (idx) of your device (the name may change, the index will usually stay the same, the index can be found in the devices section in Domoticz),
** The name/idx of your device followed by a time constraint (similar to what you can do):
*** <code>['myDevice']  = { 'at 15:*', 'at 22:** on sat, sun' }</code> The script will be executed if <code>myDevice</code> was changed and it is either between 15:00 and 16:00 or between 22:00 and 23:00 in the weekend.
* '''scenes = { ... }''': a list of scenes. The same rules as devices applies here but then for scenes.
* '''groups = { ... }''': a list of groups. The same rules as devices applies here but then for scenes.
* '''timer = { ... }''': a list of time triggers like <code>every minute</code> or <code>at 17:*</code>. See [[#timer_trigger_options|below]].
* '''variables = { ... }''': a list of user variable-names as defined in Domoticz ( Setup &gt; More options &gt; User variables). If any of the variables listed here changes, the script is executed.
* '''security = { domoticz.SECURITY_ARMEDAWAY, domoticz.SECURITY_ARMEDHOME, domoticz.SECURITY_DISARMED}''': a list of ''one or more'' security states. If the security state in Domoticz changes and it matches with any of the states listed here, the script will be executed. See <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/examples/templates/security.lua</code> for an example. See [[#Security_Panel|Security Panel]] for information about how to create a security panel device.

=== execute = function(domoticz, device/variable/scene/group, triggerInfo) ... end ===

When al the above conditions are met (active == true and the on section has at least one matching rule) then this function is called. This is the heart of your script. The function receives three possible parameters:

* the [[#Domoticz_object_API|domoticz object]]. This gives access to almost everything in your Domoticz system including all methods to manipulate them like modifying switches or sending notifications. More about the domoticz object below.
* the actual [[#Device_object_API|device]] or [[#Variable_object_API|variable]] or [[#Scene|scene]] or [[#Group|group]] that was defined in the '''on''' part and caused the script to be called. '''Note: of course, if the script was triggered by a timer event, or a security-change event this parameter is ''nil''! You may have to test this in your code if your script is triggered by timer events AND device events'''
* information about what triggered the script. This is a small table with two keys:
** '''triggerInfo.type''': (either domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_TIMER, domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_DEVICE, domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_SECURITY, domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_SCENE, domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_GROUP or domoticz.EVENT_TYPE_VARIABLE): was the script executed due to a timer event, device-change event, security-change or user variable-change event?
** '''triggerInfo.trigger''': which timer rule triggered the script in case the script was called due to a timer event. or the security state that triggered the security trigger rule. See [[#timer_trigger_options|below]] for the possible timer trigger options. Note that dzVents lists the first timer definition that matches the current time so if there are more timer triggers that could have been triggering the script, dzVents only picks the first for this trigger property.

=== data = { ... } (optional) ===

The optional data section allows you to define variables that will be persisted between script runs. These variables can get a value in your execute function (e.g. <code>domoticz.data.previousTemperature = device.temperature</code>) and the next time the script is executed this value is again available in your code (e.g. <code>if (domoticz.data.previousTemperature &lt; 20) then ...</code>. For more info see the section [[#Persistent_data|persistent data]]. ''Note that this functionality is kind of experimental. It can be a bit fragile so don't let your entire domotica system depend on the current state of these variables.''

=== logging = { ... } (optional) ===

The optional logging setting allows you to override the global logging setting of dzVents as set in Setup &gt; Settings &gt; Other &gt; EventSystem &gt; dzVents Log Level. This can be handy when you only want this script to have extensive debug logging while the rest of your script execute silently. You have these options:

* '''level''': This is the log-level you want for this script. Can be either domoticz.LOG_INFO, domoticz.LOG_MODULE_EXEC_INFO, domoticz.LOG_DEBUG or domoticz.LOG_ERROR
* '''marker''': A string that is prefixed before each log message. That way you can easily create a filter in the Domoticz log to just see these messages.

E.g:

<pre>logging = {
    level = domoticz.LOG_DEBUG,
    marker = &quot;Hey you&quot;
    },</pre>
== Some trigger examples ==

=== Device changes ===

Suppose you have two devices: a smoke detector 'myDetector' and a room temperature sensor 'roomTemp' and you want to send a notification when either the detector detects smoke or the temperature is too high:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        devices = {
            'myDetector',
            'roomTemp'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, device)
        if ((device.name == 'myDetector' and device.state == 'On') or
            (device.name == 'roomTemp' and device.temperature &gt;= 45)) then
            domoticz.notify('Fire', 'The room is on fire', domoticz.PRIORITY_EMERGENCY)
        end
    end
}</pre>
=== Scene / group changes ===

Suppose you have a scene 'myScene' and a group 'myGroup' and you want to turn on the group as soon as myScene is activated:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        scenes = {
            'myScene'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, scene)
        if (scene.state == 'On') then
            domoticz.groups('myGroup').switchOn()
        end
    end
}</pre>
Or if you have a group and if it is activated you want to send an email but only at night:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        groups = {
            ['myGroup'] = {'at nighttime'}
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, group)
        if (group.state == 'On') then
            domoticz.email('Hey', 'The group is on', 'someone@the.world.org')
        end
    end
}</pre>
=== Timer events ===

Suppose you want to check the soil humidity every 30 minutes but only during the day and every hour during the night:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        timer = {
            'every 30 minutes at daytime',
            'every 60 minutes at nighttime'
        }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, group)
        if (domoticz.devices('soil').moisture &gt; 100) then
            domoticz.devices('irrigation').switchOn().forMin(60)
        end
    end
}</pre>
=== Variable changes ===

Suppose you have a script that updates a variable 'myAmountOfMoney' and if that variable reaches a certain level you want to be notified:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        variables = { 'myAmountOfMoney' }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz, variable)
        -- variable is the variable that's triggered
        if (variable.value &gt; 1000000) then
            domoticz.notify('Rich', 'You can stop working now', domoticz.PRIORITY_HIGH)
        end
    end
}</pre>
=== Security changes ===

Suppose you have a group holding all the lights in your house and you want to switch it off as soon as the alarm is activated:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        security = { domoticz.SECURITY_ARMEDAWAY }
    },
    execute = function(domoticz)
        domoticz.groups('All lights').switchOff()
    end
}</pre>
== ''timer'' trigger options ==

There are several options for time triggers. It is important to know that Domoticz timer events are only trigger once every minute. So that is the smallest interval for you timer scripts. However, dzVents gives you great many options to have full control over when and how often your timer scripts are called (all times are in 24hr format!). :

<pre>on = {
    timer = {
        'every minute',              -- causes the script to be called every minute
        'every other minute',        -- minutes: xx:00, xx:02, xx:04, ..., xx:58
        'every &lt;xx&gt; minutes',        -- starting from xx:00 triggers every xx minutes
                                     -- (0 &gt; xx &lt; 60)
        'every hour',                -- 00:00, 01:00, ..., 23:00  (24x per 24hrs)
        'every other hour',          -- 00:00, 02:00, ..., 22:00  (12x per 24hrs)
        'every &lt;xx&gt; hours',          -- starting from 00:00, triggers every xx
                                     -- hours (0 &gt; xx &lt; 24)
        'at 13:45',                  -- specific time
        'at *:45',                   -- every 45th minute in the hour
        'at 15:*',                   -- every minute between 15:00 and 16:00
        'at 12:45-21:15',            -- between 12:45 and 21:15. You cannot use '*'!
        'at 19:30-08:20',            -- between 19:30 and 8:20 then next day
        'at 13:45 on mon,tue',       -- at 13:45 only on Monday en Tuesday (english)
        'every hour on sat',         -- you guessed it correctly
        'at sunset',                 -- uses sunset/sunrise info from Domoticz
        'at sunrise',
        'at sunset on sat,sun',
        'xx minutes before sunset',
        'xx minutes after sunset',
        'xx minutes before sunrise',
        'xx minutes after sunrise'   -- guess ;-)
        'between aa and bb'          -- aa/bb can be a time stamp like 15:44
                                     -- aa/bb can be sunrise/sunset
                                     -- aa/bb can be 'xx minutes before/after
                                        sunrise/sunset'
        'at nighttime',              -- between sunset and sunrise
        'at daytime',                -- between sunrise and sunset
        'at daytime on mon,tue',     -- between sunrise and sunset
                                        only on monday and tuesday

        -- or if you want to go really wild:
        'at nighttime at 21:32-05:44 every 5 minutes on sat, sun',
        'every 10 minutes between 20 minutes before sunset and 30 minutes after sunrise on mon,fri,tue'

        -- or just do it yourself:
        function(domoticz)
            -- you can use domoticz.time to get the current time
            -- note that this function is called every minute!
            -- custom code that either returns true or false
            ...
        end
   },</pre>
}

When combining you have to consider what is a range and what is a moment. A moment cannot be combined with a 'every xx minutes'. That doesn't make sense.

'''One important note: if Domoticz, for whatever reason, skips a beat (skips a timer event) then you may miss the trigger! So you may have to build in some fail-safe checks or some redundancy if you have critical time-based stuff to control. There is nothing dzVents can do about it'''

Another important issue: the way it is implemented right now the <code>every xx minutes</code> and <code>every xx hours</code> is a bit limited. The interval resets at every *:00 (for minutes) or 00:* for hours. So you need an interval that is an integer divider of 60 (or 24 for the hours). So you can do every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30 minutes only.

= The domoticz object =

And now the most interesting part. Without dzVents all the device information was scattered around in a dozen global Lua tables like <code>otherdevices</code> or <code>devicechanged</code>. You had to write a lot of code to collect all this information and build your logic around it. And, when you want to update switches and stuff you had to fill the commandArray with often low-level stuff in order to make it work. Fear no more: introducing the '''domoticz object'''.

The domoticz object contains everything that you need to know in your scripts and all the methods to manipulate your devices and sensors. Getting this information has never been more easy:

<code>domoticz.time.isDayTime</code> or <code>domoticz.devices('My sensor').temperature</code> or <code>domoticz.devices('My sensor').lastUpdate.minutesAgo</code>.

So this object structure contains all the information logically arranged where you would expect it to be. Also, it harbors methods to manipulate Domoticz or devices. dzVents will create the commandArray contents for you and all you have to do is something like <code>domoticz.devices(123).switchOn().forMin(5).afterSec(10)</code> or <code>domoticz.devices('My dummy sensor').updateBarometer(1034, domoticz.BARO_THUNDERSTORM)</code>.

''The intention is that you don't have to construct low-level commandArray-commands for Domoticz anymore!'' The domoticz object tries to encapsulate every low-level commandArray-command into a nice API. If there is still something missing, please file a report in the Domoticz issue-tracker on GitHub and until then you can always use the sendCommand method which will dispatch the command to the commandArray

One tip: '''Make sure that all your devices have unique names!! dzVents will give you warnings in the logs if device names are not unique.'''

== Domoticz object API ==

The domoticz object holds all information about your Domoticz system. It has a couple of global attributes and methods to query and manipulate your system. It also has a collection of '''devices''', '''variables''' (user variables in Domoticz), '''scenes''', '''groups''' and when applicable, a collection of '''changedDevices''' and '''changedVariables'''. All these collections each have three iterator functions: <code>forEach(function)</code>, <code>filter(function)</code> and <code>reduce(function)</code> to make searching for devices easier. See [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]] below.

=== Domoticz attributes and methods ===

* '''changedDevices(idx/name)''': ''Function''. A function returning the device by idx (or name). To iterate over all changed devices do: <code>domoticz.changedDevices().forEach(..)</code>. See [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]]. Note that you cannot do <code>for i, j in pairs(domoticz.changedDevices()) do .. end</code>.
* '''changedVariables(idx/name)''': ''Function''. A function returning the user variable by idx or name. To iterate over all changed variables do: <code>domoticz.changedVariables().forEach(..)</code>. See [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]]. Note that you cannot do <code>for i, j in pairs(domoticz.changedVariables()) do .. end</code>.

=== Looping through the collections: iterators ===

The domoticz object has a couple of collections (tables): devices, scenes, groups, variables, changedDevices and changedVariables. In order to make iterating over these collections easier, dzVents has three iterator methods so you don't need to use the <code>pair()</code> or <code>ipairs()</code> function anymore (less code to write):

# '''find(function)''': Returns the item in the collection for which <code>function</code> returns true. When no item is found <code>find</code> returns nil.
# '''forEach(function)''': Executes a provided function once per array element. The function receives the item in the collection (device or variable). If you return ''false'' in the function then the loop is aborted.
# '''filter(function)''': returns items in the collection for which the function returns true.
# '''reduce(function, initial)''': Loop over all items in the collection and do some calculation with it. You call it with the function and the initial value. Each iteration the function is called with the accumulator and the item in the collection. The function does something with the accumulator and returns a new value for it.

Best to illustrate with an example:

find():

<pre>local myDevice = domoticz.devices().find(function(device)
    return device.name == 'myDevice'
end)
domoticz.log('Id: ' .. myDevice.id)</pre>
forEach():

<pre>domoticz.devices().forEach(function(device)
    if (device.batteryLevel &lt; 20) then
        -- do something
    end
end)</pre>
filter():

<pre>local deadDevices = domoticz.devices().filter(function(device)
    return (device.lastUpdate.minutesAgo &gt; 60)
end)
deadDevices.forEach(function(zombie)
    -- do something
end)</pre>
Of course you can chain:

<pre>domoticz.devices().filter(function(device)
    return (device.lastUpdate.minutesAgo &gt; 60)
end).forEach(function(zombie)
    -- do something with the zombie
end)</pre>
Using a reducer to count all devices that are switched on:

<pre>local count = domoticz.devices().reduce(function(acc, device)
    if (device.state == 'On') then
        acc = acc + 1 -- increase the accumulator
    end
    return acc -- always return the accumulator
end, 0) -- 0 is the initial value for the accumulator</pre>
=== Contants ===

The domoticz object has a couple of constants that you can use in your code e.g. <code>domoticz.LOG_INFO</code>:

* '''ALERTLEVEL_GREY''', '''ALERTLEVEL_GREEN''', '''ALERTLEVEL_ORANGE''', '''ALERTLEVEL_RED''', '''ALERTLEVEL_YELLOW''': For updating text sensors.
* '''BARO_CLOUDY''', '''BARO_CLOUDY_RAIN''', '''BARO_STABLE''', '''BARO_SUNNY''', '''BARO_THUNDERSTORM''', '''BARO_NOINFO''', '''BARO_UNSTABLE''': For updating barometric values.

* '''PRIORITY_LOW''', '''PRIORITY_MODERATE''', '''PRIORITY_NORMAL''', '''PRIORITY_HIGH''', '''PRIORITY_EMERGENCY''': For notification priority.
* '''SECURITY_ARMEDAWAY''', '''SECURITY_ARMEDHOME''', '''SECURITY_DISARMED''': For security state.

== Device object API ==

Each device in Domoticz can be found in the <code>domoticz.devices()</code> collection as listed above. The device object has a set of fixed attributes like ''name'' and ''idx''. Many devices though have different attributes and methods depending on there (hardware)type, subtype and other device specific identifiers. So it is possible that you will get an error if you call a method on a device that doesn't support it. If that is the case please check the device properties (can also be done in your script code!).

dzVents already recognizes most of the devices and creates the proper attributes and methods. It is always possible that your device-type has attributes that are not recognized. If that's the case please create a ticket in Domoticz issue-tracker on GitHub and an adapter for that device will be added.

Most of the time when your device is not recognized you can always use the <code>rawData</code> attribute as that will almost always hold all the data that is available in Domoticz.

=== Device attributes and methods for all devices ===

* '''active''': ''Boolean''. Is true for some common states like 'On' or 'Open' or 'Motion'. Same as bState.
* '''batteryLevel''': ''Number'' If applicable for that device then it will be from 0-100.
* '''bState''': ''Boolean''. Is true for some common states like 'On' or 'Open' or 'Motion'. Better use active.
* '''changed''': ''Boolean''. True if the device was changed
* '''description''': ''String''. Description of the device.
* '''deviceId''': ''String''. Another identifier of devices in Domoticz. dzVents uses the id(x) attribute. See device list in Domoticz' settings table.
* '''deviceSubType''': ''String''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
* '''deviceType''': ''String''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
* '''dump()''': ''Function''. Dump all attributes to the Domoticz log. This ignores the log level setting.
* '''hardwareName''': ''String''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
* '''hardwareId''': ''Number''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.

* '''icon''': ''String''. Name of the icon in Domoticz GUI.
* '''id''': ''Number''. Index of the device. You can find the index in the device list (idx column) in Domoticz settings. It's not truly an index but is unique enough for dzVents to be treated as an id.
* '''idx''': ''Number''. Same as id: index of the devie
* '''lastUpdate''': ''[[#Time_object|Time Object]]'': Time when the device was updated.
* '''name''': ''String''. Name of the device.

* '''state''': ''String''. For switches this holds the state like 'On' or 'Off'. For dimmers that are on, it is also 'On' but there is a level attribute holding the dimming level. '''For selector switches''' (Dummy switch) the state holds the ''name'' of the currently selected level. The corresponding numeric level of this state can be found in the '''rawData''' attribute: <code>device.rawData[1]</code>.
* '''signalLevel''': ''Number'' If applicable for that device then it will be from 0-100.
* '''switchType''': ''String''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
* '''switchTypeValue''': ''Number''. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
* '''timedOut''': ''Boolean''. Is true when the device couldn't be reached.
* '''unit''': ''Number''. Device unit. See device list in Domoticz' settings for the unit.
* '''update(&lt; params &gt;)''': ''Function''. Generic update method. Accepts any number of parameters that will be sent back to Domoticz. There is no need to pass the device.id here. It will be passed for you. Example to update a temperature: <code>device.update(0,12)</code>. This will eventually result in a commandArray entry <code>['UpdateDevice']='&lt;idx&gt;|0|12'</code>

=== Device attributes and methods for specific devices ===

Note that if you do not find your specific device type here you can always inspect what is in the <code>rawData</code> attribute. Please lets us know that it is missing so we can write an adapter for it (or you can write your own and submit it). You can dump all attributes for your device by calling <code>myDevice.dump()</code>. That will show you all the attributes and their values in the Domoticz. log.

=== Command options (delay, duration, event triggering) ===

Many of the commands you issue with dzVents support extra options like controlling a delay or a duration:

<pre>-- switch on for 2 minutes after 10 seconds
device.switchOn().afterSec(10).forMin(2)

-- switch on for 2 minutes after a randomized delay of 1-10 minutes
device.switchOff().withinMin(10).forMin(2)
device.close().forMin(15)
device.open().afterSec(20)
device.open().afterMin(2)

-- switch on but do not trigger follow up events
device.switchOn().silent()

-- flash a light for 3 times
device.switchOn().forSec(2).repeatAfterSec(1, 3)

-- switch the device on but only if the current state isn't already on:
device.switchOn().checkFirst()
-- this is a short for:
if (device.state == 'Off') then
    devices.switchOn()
end</pre>
==== Options: ====

* '''afterHour(hours), afterMin(minutes), afterSec(seconds)''': ''Function''. Activates the command after a certain amount of hours, minutes or seconds.
* '''checkFirst()''': ''Function''. Checks if the current state of the device is different then the desired new state. If the target state is the same, no command is sent. So if you do <code>mySwitch.switchOn().checkFirst()</code> then no switch command is sent if the switch is already on. This command is only works with switch-like devices. Not available with toggle and dim commands either.
* '''forHour(hours), forMin(minutes), forSec(seconds)''': ''Function''. Activates the command for the duration of a certain amount of hours, minutes or seconds. See table below for applicability.
* '''withinHour(hours), withinMin(minutes), withinSec(seconds)''': ''Function''. Activates the command within a certain period (specified in hours, minutes or second) ''randomly''. See table below for applicability.
* '''silent()''': ''Function''. No follow-up events will be triggered: <code>mySwitch.switchOff().silent()</code>.
* '''repeatAfterHour(hours, [amount]), repeatAfterMin(minutes, [amount]), repeatAfterSec(seconds, [amount])''': ''Function''. Repeats the sequence an x amount of times after the specified time (value). When no amount is provided an amount of 1 is used.

Note that the actual switching or changing of the device is done by Domoticz and not by dzVents. dzVents only tells Domoticz what to do. So if the options are not carried out as expected, this is likely a Domoticz or hardware issue.

==== Availability ====

The options are not always available. All the options are available to device switch-like commands like <code>myDevice.swithOff()</code>, <code>myGroup.switchOn()</code> or <code>myBlinds.open()</code>. For updating devices (usually dummy devices) like a text device <code>myTextDevice.updateText('zork')</code> you can only use <code>silent()</code>.

==== About follow-up event triggers ====

Normally if you issue a command, Domoticz will immediately trigger follow-up events and dzVents will automatically trigger event scripts if you have defined one. So if you trigger a scene all devices in that scene will issue a change event and if you have event triggers for these devices, they will be executed by dzVents. If you don't want this to happen add <code>.silent()</code> to your commands.

=== Create your own device adapter ===

It is possible that your device is not recognized by dzVents. You can still operate it using the generic device attributes and methods but it is much nicer if you have device specific attributes and methods. Take a look at the existing adapters. You can find them in <code>/path/to/domoticz/dzVents/runtime/device-adapters</code>. Just copy an existing adapter and adapt it to your needs. You can turn debug logging on and inspect the file <code>domoticzData.lua</code> in the dzVents folder. There you can see what the unique signature is for your device type. Usually it is a combination of deviceType and deviceSubType. But you can use any of the device attributes in the <code>matches</code> function. The matches function checks if the device type is suitable for your adapter and the <code>process</code> function actually creates your specific attributes and methods. Also, if you call <code>myDevice.dump()</code> you will see all attributes and methods and the attribute <code>_adapters</code> shows you a list of applied adapters for that device. Finally register your adapter in <code>Adapters.lua</code>. Please share your adapter when it is ready and working.

== Variable object API (user variables) ==

User variables created in Domoticz have these attributes and methods:

=== Variable attributes and methods ===

* '''changed''': ''Boolean''. Was the device changed.
* '''date''': ''Date''. If type is domoticz.DATE. See lastUpdate for the sub-attributes.
* '''id''': ''Number''. Index of the variable.
* '''lastUpdate''': ''[[#Time_object|Time Object]]''
* '''name''': ''String''. Name of the variable
* '''set(value)''': Tells Domoticz to update the variable. Supports timing options. See [[#Switch_timing_options_.28delay.2C_duration.29|above]].
* '''time''': ''Date''. If type is domoticz.TIME. See lastUpdate for the sub-attributes.
* '''type''': ''String''. Can be domoticz.INTEGER, domoticz.FLOAT, domoticz.STRING, domoticz.DATE, domoticz.TIME.
* '''value''': ''String|Number|Date|Time''. value of the variable.

== Time object ==

Many attributes represent a moment in time like <code>myDevice.lastUpdate</code> or <code>domoticz.time</code>. In dzVents a time-like attribute is an object with properties and methods which make your life easier.

<pre>    print(myDevice.lastUpdate.minutesAgo)
    print(myDevice.lastUpdate.daysAgo)

    -- compare two times
    print(domoticz.time.compare(myDevice.lastUpdate).seconds))</pre>
And you can also create your own:

<pre>    local Time = require('Time')
    local t = Time('2016-12-12 07:35:00') -- must be this format!!</pre>
or if you don't pass a time string:

<pre>    local Time = require('Time')
    local currentTime = Time()</pre>
You can use this in combination with the various dzVents time attributes:

<pre>    local Time = require('Time')
    local t = Time('2016-12-12 07:35:00')

    local tonight = Time(domoticz.time.rawDate .. ' 20:00:00')
    print (tonight.getISO())
    -- will print something like: 2016-12-12T20:00:00Z
    print(t.minutesAgo) -- difference from 'now' in minutes

    -- and you can feed it with all same rules as you use
    -- for the timer = { .. } section:
    if (t.matchesRule('at 16:00-21:00')) then
        -- t is in between 16:00 and 21:00
    end

    -- very powerful if you want to compare two time instances:
    local anotherTime = Time('...') -- fill-in some time here
    print(t.compare(anotherTime).seconds) -- diff in seconds between t and anotherTime.
</pre>
=== Time properties and methods: ===

Creation:

<pre>local Time = require('Time')
local now = Time() -- current time
local someTime = Time('2017-12-31 22:19:15')
local uctTime = Time('2017-12-31 22:19:15', true)</pre>
* '''compare(time)''': ''Function''. Compares the current time object with another time object. ''Make sure you pass a Time object!'' Returns a table (all values are ''positive'', use the compare property to see if ''time'' is in the past or future):
** '''milliseconds''': Total difference in milliseconds.
** '''seconds''': Total difference in whole seconds.
** '''minutes''': Total difference in whole minutes.
** '''hours''': Total difference in whole hours.
** '''days''': Total difference in whole days.
** '''compare''': 0 = both are equal, 1 = ''time'' is in the future, -1 = ''time'' is in the past.
* '''day''': ''Number''
* '''daysAgo''': ''Number''
* '''getISO''': ''Function''. Returns the ISO 8601 formatted date.
* '''hour''': ''Number''
* '''hoursAgo''': ''Number''. Number of hours since the last update.
* '''isToday''': ''Boolean''. Indicates if the device was updated today
* '''isUTC''': ''Boolean''.
* '''matchesRule(rule) ''': ''Function''. Returns true if the rule matches with the time. See [[#timer_trigger_options|time trigger options]] for rule examples.
* '''min''': ''Number''
* '''minutesAgo''': ''Number''. Number of minutes since the last update.
* '''month''': ''Number''
* '''msAgo''': ''Number''. Number of milliseconds since the last update.
* '''raw''': ''String''. Generated by Domoticz
* '''rawDate''': ''String''. Returns the date part of the raw data.
* '''rawTime''': ''String''. Returns the time part of the raw data.
* '''sec''': ''Number''
* '''secondsSinceMidnight''': ''Number''
* '''secondsAgo''': ''Number''. Number of seconds since the last update.
* '''utcSystemTime''': ''Table''. UTC system time (only when in UTC mode):
** '''day''': ''Number''
** '''hour''': ''Number''
** '''month''': ''Number''
** '''min''': ''Number''
** '''sec''': ''Number''
** '''year''': ''Number''
* '''utcTime''': ''Table''. Time stamp in UTC time:
** '''day''': ''Number''
** '''hour''': ''Number''
** '''month''': ''Number''
** '''min''': ''Number''
** '''sec''': ''Number''
** '''year''': ''Number''
* '''year''': ''Number''

'''Note: it is currently not possible to change a time object instance.'''

== Creating shared helper functions ==

It is not unlikely that at some point you want to share Lua code among your scripts. Normally in Lua you would have to create a module and require that module in all you scripts. But dzVents makes that easier for you: Inside your scripts folder create a <code>global_data.lua</code> script (same as for global persistent data) and feed it with this code:

<pre>return {
    helpers = {
        myHandyFunction = function(param1, param2)
            -- do your stuff
        end
    }
}</pre>
Save the file and from then on you can use myHandyFunction everywhere in your event scripts:

<pre>return {
    ...
    execute = function(domoticz, device)
        local results = domoticz.helpers.myHandyFunction('bla', 'boo')
    end
}</pre>
No requires or dofiles needed. Simple as that.

'''Important note: if you need to access the domoticz object in your helper function you have to pass it as a parameter:'''

<pre>return {
    helpers = {
        myHandyFunction = function(domoticz, param1, param2)
            -- do your stuff
            domoticz.log('Hey')
        end
    }
}</pre>
And pass it along:

<pre>return {
    ...
    execute = function(domoticz, device)
        local results = domoticz.helpers.myHandyFunction(domoticz, 'bla', 'boo')
    end
}</pre>
== Requiring your own modules ==

If you don't want to use the helpers support but want to require your own modules. Place them either in <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/modules</code> or <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/scripts/modules</code> as these folders are already added to the Lua package path. You can just require those modules: <code>local myModule = require('myModule')</code>

= Persistent data =

In many situations you need to store some device state or other information in your scripts for later use. Like knowing what the state was of a device the previous time the script was executed or what the temperature in a room was 10 minutes ago. Without dzVents you had to resort to user variables. These are global variables that you create in the Domoticz GUI and that you can access in your scripts like: domoticz.variables('previousTemperature').

Now, for some this is rather inconvenient and they want to control this state information in the event scripts themselves or want to use all of Lua's variable types. dzVents has a solution for that: '''persistent script data'''. This can either be on the script level or on a global level.

== Script level persistent variables ==

Persistent script variables are available in your scripts and whatever value put in them is persisted and can be retrieved in the next script run.

Here is an example. Let's say you want to send a notification if some switch has been actived 5 times:

<pre>    return {
        active = true,
        on = {
            devices = { 'MySwitch' }
        },
        data = {
            counter = {initial=0}
        },
        execute = function(domoticz, switch)
            if (domoticz.data.counter = 5) then
                domoticz.notify('The switch was pressed 5 times!')
                domoticz.data.counter = 0 -- reset the counter
            else
                domoticz.data.counter = domoticz.data.counter + 1
            end
        end
    }</pre>
Here you see the <code>data</code> section defining a persistent variable called <code>counter</code>. It also defines an initial value. From then on you can read and set the variable in your script.

You can define as many variables as you like and put whatever value in there that you like. It doesn't have to be just a number, you can even put the entire device state in it:

<pre>    return {
        active = true,
        on = {
            devices = { 'MySwitch' }
        },
        data = {
            previousState = {initial=nil}
        },
        execute = function(domoticz, switchDevice)
            -- set the previousState:
            domoticz.data.previousState = switchDevice

            -- read something from the previousState:
            if (domoticz.data.previousState.temperature &gt; .... ) then
            end
        end
    }</pre>
'''Note that you cannot call methods on previousState like switchOn(). Only the data is persisted.'''

=== Size matters and watch your speed!! ===

If you decide to put tables in the persistent data (or arrays) beware to not let them grow as it will definitely slow down script execution because dzVents has to serialize and deserialize the data back and from the file system. Better is to use the historical option as described below.

== Global persistent variables ==

Next to script level variables you can also define global variables. As script level variables are only available in the scripts that define them, global variables can be accessed and changed in every script. All you have to do is create a script file called <code>global_data.lua</code> in your scripts folder with this content (same file where you can also put your shared helper functions):

<pre>    return {
        helpers = {},
        data = {
            peopleAtHome = { initial = false },
            heatingProgramActive = { initial = false }
        }
    }</pre>
Just define the variables that you need and access them in your scripts:

<pre>    return {
        active = true,
        on = {
            devices = {'WindowSensor'}
        },
        execute = function(domoticz, windowSensor)
            if (domoticz.globalData.heatingProgramActive
                and windowSensor.state == 'Open') then
                domoticz.notify(&quot;Hey don't open the window when the heating is on!&quot;)
            end
        end
    }</pre>
== A special kind of persistent variables: ''history = true'' ==

In some situation, storing a previous value for a sensor is not enough and you would like to have more previous values for example when you want to calculate an average over several readings or see if there was a constant rise or decrease. Of course you can define a persistent variable holding a table:

<pre>    return {
        active = true,
        on = {
            devices = {'MyTempSensor'}
        },
        data = {
            previousData = { initial = {} }
        },
        execute = function(domoticz, sensor)
            -- add new data
            table.insert(domoticz.data.previousData, sensor.temperature)

            -- calculate the average
            local sum = 0, count = 0
            for i, temp in pairs(domoticz.data.previousData) do
                sum = sum + temp
                count = count + 1
            end
            local average = sum / count
        end
    }</pre>
The problem with this is that you have to do a lot of bookkeeping yourself to make sure that there isn't too much data to store (see [[#How_does_the_storage_stuff_work.3F|below how it works]]) and many statistical stuff requires a lot of code. Fortunately, dzVents has done this for you:

<pre>    return {
        active = true,
        on = {
            devices = {'MyTempSensor'}
        },
        data = {
            temperatures = { history = true, maxItems = 10 }
        },
        execute = function(domoticz, sensor)
            -- add new data
            domoticz.data.temperatures.add(sensor.temperature)

            -- average
            local average = domoticz.data.temperatures.avg()

            -- maximum value in the past hour:
            local max = domoticz.data.temperatures.maxSince('01:00:00')
        end
    }</pre>
=== Historical variables API ===

==== Defining ====

You define a script variable or global variable in the data section and set <code>history = true</code>:

<pre>..
data = {
    var1 = { history = true, maxItems = 10, maxHours = 1, maxMinutes = 5 }
}</pre>
* '''maxItems''': ''Number''. Controls how many items are stored in the variable. maxItems wins over maxHours and maxMinutes.
* '''maxHours''': ''Number''. Data older than <code>maxHours</code> from now will be discarded. So if you set it to 2 than data older than 2 hours will be removed at the beginning of the script.
* '''maxMinutes''': ''Number''. Same as maxHours but, you guessed it: for minutes this time.. All these options can be combined but maxItems wins. '''And again: don't store too much data. Just put only in there what you really need!'''

==== Add ====

When you defined your historical variable you can new values to the list like this:

<pre>domoticz.data.myVar.add(value)</pre>
As soon as you do that, this new value is put on top of the list and shifts the older values one place down the line. If <code>maxItems</code> was reached then the oldest value will be discarded. ''All methods like calculating averages or sums will immediately use this new value!'' So, if you don't want this to happen set the new value at the end of your script or after you have done your analysis.

Basically you can put any kind of data in the historical variable. It can be a numbers, strings but also more complex data like tables. However, in order to be able to use the statistical methods you will have to set numeric values or tell dzVents how to get a numeric value from you data. More on that later.

==== Getting. It's all about time! ====

Getting values from a historical variable is basically done by using an index where 1 is the newest value , 2 is the second to newest and so on:

<pre>local item = domoticz.data.myVar.get(5)
print(item.data)</pre>
However, all data in the storage is time-stamped so getting something from the internal storage will get you this:

<pre>local item = domoticz.data.myVar.getLatest()
print(item.time.secondsAgo) -- access the time stamp
print(item.data) -- access the data</pre>
The time attribute by itself is a table with many properties that help you inspect the data points more easily. See [[#Time_object|Time Object]] for all attributes and methods.

==== Interacting with your data: statistics! ====

Once you have data points in your historical variable you can interact with it and get all kinds of statistical information from the set. Many of the functions needed for this interaction require one or two indexes or a time specification (time ago):

===== Index =====

All data in the set can be addressed using an index. The item with index = 1 is the youngest and the item with the highest index is the oldest (and beware, if you have called <code>add()</code> first, then the first item is that new value!). You can always check the size of the set by inspecting <code>myVar.size</code>.

===== Time specification (''timeAgo'') =====

Every datapoint in the set has a time stamp and of course the set is always ordered so that the youngest item is the first and the oldest item the last. Many functions require you to specify a moment in the past. You do this by passing a string in this format:

<pre>hh:mm:ss</pre>
Where hh is the amount of hours ago, mm the amount of minutes and ss the amount of seconds. They will all be added together and you don't have to consider 60 minute boundaries etc. So this is a valid time specification:

<pre>12:88:03</pre>
Which will point to the data point at or around <code>12*3600 + 88*60 + 3 = 48.483 seconds</code> in the past. Example:

<pre>-- get average since the past 30 minutes:
local avg = myVar.avgSince('00:30:00')</pre>
===== Getting data points =====

* '''get(idx)''': Returns the idx-th item in the set. Same as <code>myVar.storage[idx]</code>.
* '''getAtTime( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]] )''': Returns the data point ''closest'' to the moment as specified by <code>timeAgo</code>. So <code>myVar.getAtTime('1:00:00')</code> returns the item that is closest to one hour old. So it may be a bit younger or a bit older than 1 hour.
* '''getLatest( ):''' Returns the youngest item in the set. Same as <code>print(myVar.get(1).data)</code>.
* '''getOldest( )''': Returns the oldest item in the set. Same as <code>print(myVar.get(myVar.size).data)</code>.
* '''size''': Return the amount of data points in the set.
* '''subset( [fromIdx], [toIdx] )''': Returns a subset of the stored data. If you omit <code>fromIdx</code> then it starts at 1. If you omit <code>toIdx</code> then it takes all items until the end of the set (oldest). So <code>myVar.subset()</code> returns all data. The result set supports [[#Looping_through_the_data:_iterators|iterators]] <code>forEach</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>find</code> and <code>reduce</code>.
* '''subsetSince( [[[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]]] )''': Returns a subset of the stored data since the relative time specified by timeAgo. So calling <code>myVar.subsetSince('00:60:00')</code> returns all items that have been added to the list in the past 60 minutes. The result set supports [[#Looping_through_the_data:_iterators|iterators]] <code>forEach</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>find</code> and <code>reduce</code>.
* '''reset( ):''' Removes all the items from the set. Could be handy if you want to start over. It could be a good practice to do this often when you know you don't need older data. For instance when you turn on a heater and you just want to monitor rising temperatures starting from this moment when the heater is activated. If you don't need data points from before, then you may call reset.

====== Looping through the data: iterators ======

There are a couple of convenience methods to make looping through the data set easier. This is similar to the iterators as described [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|above]]:

<ul>
<li>'''forEach(function)''': Loop over all items in the set: E.g.: <code>myVar.forEach( function( item, index, collection) ... end )</code></li>
<li>'''filter(function)''': Create a filtered set of items. The function receives the item and returns true if the item should be in the result set. E.g. get a set with item values larger than 20: <code>subset = myVar.filter( function (item) return (item.data &gt; 20) end )</code>.</li>
<li>'''find(function)''': Search for a specific item in the set: E.g. find the first item with a value higher than 20: <code>local item = myVar.find( function (item) return (item.data &gt; 20) end )</code>.</li>
<li><p>'''reduce(function, initial)''': Loop over all items in the set and do some calculation with it. You call reduce with the function and the initial value. Each iteration the function is called with the accumulator. The function does something with the accumulator and returns a new value for it. Once you get the hang of it, it is very powerful. Best to give an example. Suppose you want to sum all values:</p>
<pre>local sum = myVar.reduce(function(acc, item)
    local value = item.data
    return acc + value
end, 0)</pre></li></ul>

Suppose you want to get data points older than 45 minutes and count the values that are higher than 20 (of course there are more ways to do this):

<pre>local myVar = domoticz.data.myVar

local olderItems = myVar.filter(function (item)
    return (item.time.minutesAgo &gt; 45)
end)

local count = olderItems.reduce(function(acc, item)
    if (item.data &gt; 20) then
        acc = acc + 1
    end
    return acc
end, 0)

print('Found ' .. tostring(count) .. ' items')</pre>
===== Statistical functions =====

In order to use the statistical functions you have to put ''numerical'' data in the set. Or you have to provide a function for getting this data. So, if it is just numbers you can just do this:

<pre>myVar.add(myDevice.temperature) -- adds a number to the set
myVar.avg() -- returns the average</pre>
If, however you add more complex data or you want to do a computation first, then you have to tell dzVents how to get to this data. So let's say you do this to add data to the set:

<pre>myVar.add( { 'person' = 'John', waterUsage = u })</pre>
Where <code>u</code> is some variable that got its value earlier. Now if you want to calculate the average water usage then dzVents will not be able to do this because it doesn't know the value is actually in the <code>waterUsage</code> attribute! You will get <code>nil</code>.

To make this work you have to provide a '''getValue function''' in the data section when you define the historical variable:

<pre>return {
    active = true,
    on = {...},
    data = {
        myVar = {
            history = true,
            maxItems = 10,
            getValue = function(item)
                return item.data.waterUsage -- return number!!
            end
        }
    },
    execute = function()...end
}</pre>
This function tells dzVents how to get the numeric value for a data item. '''Note: the <code>getValue</code> function has to return a number!'''.

Of course, if you don't intend to use any of these statistical functions you can put whatever you want in the set. Even mixed data. No-one cares but you.

====== Functions ======

<ul>
<li>'''avg( [fromIdx], [toIdx], [default] )''': Calculates the average of all item values within the range <code>fromIdx</code> to <code>toIdx</code>. You can specify a <code>default</code> value for when there is no data in the set otherwise it returns 0.</li>
<li>'''avgSince( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]], default )''': Calculates the average of all data points since <code>timeAgo</code>. Returns <code>default</code> if there is no data otherwise 0. E.g.: <code>local avg = myVar.avgSince('00:30:00')</code> returns the average over the past 30 minutes.</li>
<li>'''min( [fromIdx], [toIdx] )''': Returns the lowest value in the range defined by fromIdx and toIdx.</li>
<li>'''minSince( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]] )''': Same as '''min''' but now within the <code>timeAgo</code> interval.</li>
<li>'''max( [fromIdx], [toIdx] )''': Returns the highest value in the range defined by fromIdx and toIdx.</li>
<li>'''maxSince( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]] )''': Same as '''max''' but now within the <code>timeAgo</code> interval.</li>
<li>'''sum( [fromIdx], [toIdx] )''': Returns the summation of all values in the range defined by fromIdx and toIdx. It will return 0 when there is no data.</li>
<li>'''sumSince( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]] )''': Same as '''sum''' but now within the <code>timeAgo</code> interval. It will return 0 when there is no data in the interval.</li>
<li>'''delta( fromIdx, toIdx, [smoothRange], [default] )''': Returns the delta (difference) between items specified by <code>fromIdx</code> and <code>toIdx</code>. You have to provide a valid range (no <code>nil</code> values). [[#About_data_smoothing|Supports data smoothing]] when providing a <code>smoothRange</code> value. Returns <code>default</code> if there is not enough data.</li>
<li>'''deltaSince( [[#Time_specification_.28timeAgo.29|timeAgo]], [smoothRange], [default] )''': Same as '''delta''' but now within the <code>timeAgo</code> interval.</li>
<li><p>'''localMin( [smoothRange], default )''': Returns the first minimum value (and the item holding the minimal value) in the past. [[#About_data_smoothing|Supports data smoothing]] when providing a <code>smoothRange</code> value. So if you have this range of values in the data set (from new to old): <code>10 8 7 5 3 4 5 6</code>. Then it will return <code>3</code> because older values ''and'' newer values are higher: a local minimum. You can use this if you want to know at what time a temperature started to rise after have been dropping. E.g.:</p>
<pre>local value, item = myVar.localMin()
print(' minimum was : ' .. value .. ': ' .. item.time.secondsAgo .. ' seconds ago' )</pre></li>
<li>'''localMax([smoothRange], default)''': Same as '''localMin''' but now for the maximum value. [[#About_data_smoothing|Supports data smoothing]] when providing a <code>smoothRange</code> value.</li>
<li><p>'''smoothItem(itemIdx, [smoothRange])''': Returns a the value of <code>itemIdx</code> in the set but smoothed by averaging with its neighbors. The amount of neighbors is set by <code>smoothRange</code>. See [[#About_data_smoothing|About data smoothing]].</p></li></ul>

===== About data smoothing =====

Suppose you store temperatures in the historical variable. These temperatures my have extremes. Sometimes these extremes could be due to sensor reading errors. In order to reduce the effect of these so called spikes, you could smooth out values. It is like blurring the data. Here is an example. The Raw column could be your temperatures. The other columns is calculated by averaging the neighbors. So for item 10 the calucations are:

<pre>Range=1 for t10 = (25 + 31 + 29) / 3 = 28,3
Range=2 for t10 = (16 + 25 + 31 + 29 + 26) / 5 = 25,4</pre>

If you make a chart you can make it even more visible. The red line is not smoothed and clearly has more spikes than the others:

[[File:dzvents-smoothing.png|frame|none|alt=|Smoothing]]

So, some of the statistical function allow you to provide a smoothing range. Usually a range of 1 or 2 is sufficient. I suggest to use smoothing when checking detlas, local minumums and maximums.

== How does the storage stuff work? ==

For every script file that defines persisted variables (using the <code>data={ .. }</code> section) dzVents will create storage file inside a subfolder called <code>data</code> with the name <code>__data_scriptname.lua</code>. You can always delete these data files or the entire storage folder if there is a problem with it:

<pre>domoticz/
    scripts/
        dzVents/
            data/
                __data_yourscript1.lua
                __data_yourscript2.lua
                __data_global_data.lua
            examples/
            generated_scripts/
            scripts/
                yourscript1.lua
                yourscript2.lua
                global_data.lua</pre>
If you dare to you can watch inside these files. Every time some data is changed, dzVents will stream the changes back into the data files. '''And again: make sure you don't put too much stuff in your persisted data as it may slows things down too much.'''

= Settings =

There are a couple of settings for dzVents. They can be found in Domoticz GUI: '''Setup &gt; Settings &gt; Other &gt; EventSystem''':

* '''dzVents disabled''': Tick this if you don't want any dzVents script to be executed.
* '''Log level''': Note that you can override this setting in the logging section of your script:
** ''Errors'',
** ''Errors + minimal execution info'': Errors and some minimal information about which script is being executed and why,
** ''Errors + minimal execution info + generic info''. Even more information about script execution and a bit more log formatting.
** ''Debug''. Shows everything and dzVents will create a file <code>domoticzData.lua</code> in the dzVents folder. This is a dump of all the data that is received by dzVents from Domoticz.. That data is used to create the entire dzVents data structure.
** ''No logging''. As silent as possible.

= Troubleshooting =

So, you think if you have done everything correctly but things do not work (in some way) as you expected. Here are a couple steps you can do to find the cause.

=== Is dzVents enabled? ===

Check the settings (see above) and make sure the checkbox '''dzVents disabled''' is not checked.

=== Is your script enabled? ===

Make sure the active section in your script is set to <code>true</code>: <code>active = true</code>. And, on top of that, if you are using the internal web editor to write your script make sure that your script is active there as well! It is a separate checkbox that you have to check for every script. When not active, the script name will be red in the list on the right.

=== Turn on debug logging ===

In the settings you can activate debug logging (see above). This will produce a lot of extra log messages in the Domoticz log (don't forget to turn it off when you are done troubleshooting!). Best is to monitor the log through the command line as the log in the browser sometimes tends to not always show all log messages. See the Domoticz manual for how to do that.

When debug logging is enabled every time dzVents kicks into action (Domoticz throws an event) it will log it and on top of that it will create a file <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/domoticzData.lua</code> with a dump of the data that is sent to dzVents. This data lies at the core of the dzVents object model. You can open this file in an editor and see if you can find your device/variable/scene/group in there. Note that the data in the file is not exactly the same as what you will get when you interact with dzVents but it is a good start. If your device is not in the data file then you will not have access to it in dzVents and dzVents will not be able to match triggers with that device. Something's wrong if you expect your device to be in there but it is not (is the device active/used?).

So, every time Domoticz starts dzVents ánd debug logging is enabled you should see these lines:

<pre>dzVents version: x.y.z
Event trigger type: xxxx</pre>
Where xxxx can be time, device, uservariable, security or scenegroup. That should give you a clue what kind of event is active. If you don't see this information then dzVents is not active (or debug logging is not active).

=== Script is still not executed ===

If for some reason you script is not executed while all of the above is done, it is possible that your triggers are not correct. Either the time rule is not matching with the current time (try to set the rule to <code>every minute</code> or something simple). Or you the device name is not correct (check casing) or you use an id that doesn't exist. Note that in the on-section you cannot use the dzVents domoticz object!

Make sure that if you use an id in the on-section that this id is correct. Go to the device list in Domoticz and find the device and make sure the device is in the 'used' list!. Unused devices will not create an event. Find the idx for the device and use that as the id.

Also, make sure that your device names are unique! dzVents will throw a warning in the log if you have a double match for the device name. It's just best practice to have unique names for your devices. Use some clever naming like prefixing like 'Temperature: living room' or 'Lights: living room'. That also makes using wild cards on your on-section easier.

If your script is still not triggered, you can try to create a classic Lua event script and see if that does work.

=== Debugging your script ===

A simple way to inspect a device in your script is to dump it to the log: <code>myDevice.dump()</code>. This will dump all the attributes (and more) of the device so you can inspect what its state is. Use print statements or domoticz.log() statements in your script at cricital locations to see if the Lua interpreter reaches that line. You can also use the lodash print command as that is now available with dzVents as well as that command can also print tables:

<pre>local _ = require('lodash')
_.print(myTable, 'Some value')</pre>
Don't try to print a device object though, use the dump() method for that.

If you place a print statement all the way at the top of your script file it will be printed every time dzVents loads your script (that is done at the beginning of each event cycle). Sometimes that is handy to see if your script gets loaded in the first place. If you don't see your print statement in the log, then likely dzVents didn't load it and it will not work.

=== Get help ===

The Domoticz forum is a great resource for help and solutions. Check the [https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=59 dzVents forum].

= Other interesting stuff =

== Lodash for Lua ==

Lodash is a well known and very popular Javascript library filled with dozens of handy helper functions that really make you life a lot easier. Fortunately there is also a Lua version. When using dzVents you also have access to this library as it comes with dzVents. All you have to do is require it in your code:

<pre>local _ = require('lodash')
_.print(_.indexOf({2, 3, 'x', 4}, 'x'))</pre>
Or if you want to have it available in all your scripts automatically (as a global), add this line at the top of your global_data.lua script:

<pre>_G._ = require('lodash') -- create a global _</pre>
Check out the great documentation [http://axmat.github.io/lodash.lua/ here].

= Migrating from version 1.x.x =

As you can read in the change log below there are a couple of changes in 2.0 that will break older scrtips.

== The 'on={..}' section. ==

The on-section needs the items to be grouped based on their type. So prior to 2.0 you had

<pre>    on = {
        'myDevice',
        'anotherDevice'
    }</pre>
In 2.x you have:

<pre>    on = {
        devices = {
            'myDevice',
            'anotherDevice'
        }
    }</pre>
The same for timer options, in 1.x.x:

<pre>    on = {
        ['timer'] = 'every 10 minutes on mon,tue'
    }</pre>
2.x:

<pre>    on = {
        timer = {
            'every 10 minutes on mon,tue'
        }
    }</pre>
Or when you have a combination, in 1.x.x

<pre>    on = {
            'myDevice',
            ['timer'] = 'every 10 minutes on mon,tue'
        }
    }
</pre>
2.x:

<pre>    on = {
        devices = {
            'myDevice'
        }
        timer = {
            'every 10 minutes on mon,tue'
        }
    }
</pre>
== Getting devices, groups, scenes etc. ==

Prior to 2.x you did this to get a device:

<pre>    domoticz.devices['myDevice']
    domoticz.groups['myGroup']
    domoticz.scenes['myScene']
    domoticz.variables['myVariable']
    domoticz.changedDevices['myDevices']
    domoticz.changeVariables['myVariable']</pre>
Change that to:

<pre>    domoticz.devices('myDevice') -- a function call
    domoticz.groups('myGroup')
    domoticz.scenes('myScene')
    domoticz.variables('myVariable')
    domoticz.changedDevices('myDevices')
    domoticz.changeVariables('myVariable')</pre>
== Looping through the devices (and other dzVents collections), iterators ==

Earlier you could do this:

<pre>    for i, device in pairs(domoticz.devices) do
        domoticz.log(device.name)
    end</pre>
In 2.x that is no longer possible. You now have to do this:

<pre>    domoticz.devices().forEach(function(device)
        domoticz.log(device.name)
    end)</pre>
The same applies for the other collections like groups, scenes, variables, changedDevices and changedVariables. Note that you can easily search for a device using iterators as well:

<pre>    local myDevice = domoticz.devices().find(function(device)
        return device.name == 'deviceImLookingFor'
    end)</pre>
For more information about these iterators see: [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]].

== Timed commands ==

Prior to 2.0 you did this if you wanted to turn a switch off after a couple seconds:

<pre>    domoticz.devices['mySwitch'].switchOff().after_sec(10)</pre>
In 2.x:

<pre>    domoticz.devices('mySwitch').switchOff().afterSec(10)</pre>
The same applies for for_min and with_min.

== Device attributes ==

One thing you have to check is that some device attributes are no longer formatted strings with units in there like WhToday. It is possible that you have some scripts that deal with strings instead of values.

== Changed attributes ==

In 1.x.x you had a changedAttributes collection on a device. That is no longer there. Just remove it and just check for the device to be changed instead.

== Using rawData ==

Prior to 2.x you likely used the rawData attribute to get to certain device values. With 2.x this is likely not needed anymore. Check the various device types above and check if there isn't a named attribute for you device type. dzVents 2.x uses so called device adapters which should take care of interpreting raw values and put them in named attributes for you. If you miss your device you can file a ticket or create an adapter yourself. See [[File:#Create_your_own_device_adapter|Create your own device adapter]].

== What happened to fetch http data? ==

In 2.x it is no longer needed to make timed json calls to Domoticz to get extra device information into your scripts. Very handy. On the other hand, you have to make sure that dzVents can access the json without the need for a password because some commands are issued using json calls by dzVents. Make sure that in Domoticz settings under '''Local Networks (no username/password)''' you add <code>127.0.0.1</code> and you're good to go.

= Change log =

[2.3.0]

* Added <code>active</code> attribute to devices (more logical naming than the attribute 'bState'). <code>myDevice.active</code> is true or false depending on a set of known state values (like On, Off, Open, Closed etc). Use like <code>if mySwitch.active then .. end</code>
* Added <code>domoticz.urlEncode</code> method on the <code>domoticz</code> object so you can prepare a string before using it with <code>openURL()</code>.
* Updating devices, user variables, scenes and groups now always trigger the event system for follow-up events.
* Added support for groups and scenes change-event scripts. Use <code>on = { scenes = { 'myScene1', 'myScene2' }, groups = {'myGroup1'} }</code>
* Added adapter for the new Temperature+Barometer device.
* Added <code>domoticz.startTime</code> giving you the time at which the Domoticz service was started. Returns a Time object.
* Added <code>domoticz.systemUptime</code> (in seconds) indicating the number of seconds the machine is running. Returns a Time object.
* Added more options to the various commands/methods: e.g. <code>myDevice.switchOff().silent()</code>, <code>.forSec()</code>, <code>.forHour()</code>, <code>.afterHour()</code>, <code>.repeatAfterSec()</code>, <code>.repeatAfterMin()</code>, <code>.repeatAfterHour()</code>, <code>.withinHour()</code> and <code>.checkFirst()</code>. This now works not only for devices but also scenes, groups and user variables. See documentation about command options.
* Added <code>.silent()</code> option to commands like <code>switchOn().afterSec(4).silent()</code> causing no follow-up events to be triggered. This also works when updating non-switch-like devices, scenes, groups and user variables. If you do not call `silent()``, a follow-up event is ''always'' triggered (for devices, scenes, groups and user variables).
* Added time rule <code>between xx and yy</code>. You can now do things like: <code>between 16:34 and sunset</code> or <code>between 10 minutes before sunset and sunrise</code>. See the doc.
* Added support for milliseconds in <code>Time</code> object. This also give a ms part in the time-stamp for historical persistent data. You can now do <code>msAgo()</code> on time stamp when you inspect a data point from an history variable.
* Added <code>daysAgo()</code> to <code>Time</code> object.
* Added <code>compare(time)</code> method to <code>Time</code> object to calculate the difference between them. Returns a table. See documentation.
* Added <code>domoticz.round()</code> method to <code>domoticz</code> object.
* <code>active</code> section is now optional in your dzVents script. If you don't specify an <code>active = true/false</code> then true is assumed (script is active). Handy for when you use Domoticz' GUI script editor as it has its own way of activating and deactivating scripts.
* Added <code>humidityStatusValue</code> for humidity devices. This value matches with the values used for setting the humidity status.
* <code>Time</code> object will initialize to current time if nothing is passed: <code>local current = Time()</code>.
* Added the lua Lodash library (http://axmat.github.io/lodash.lua, MIT license).
* Fixed documentation about levelNames for selector switches and added the missing levelName.
* Moved dzVents runtime code away from the <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents</code> folder as this scripts folder contains user stuff.
* Added more trigger examples in the documentation.
* You can now put your own non-dzVents modules in your scripts folder or write them with the Domoticz GUI editor. dzVents is no longer bothered by it. You can require your modules in Lua's standard way.
* Added <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/scripts/modules</code> and <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/modules</code> to the Lua package path for custom modules. You can now place your modules in there and require them from anywhere in your scripts.
* Added dzVents-specific boilerplate/templates for internal web editor.
* Fixed the confusing setting for enabling/disabling dzVents event system in Domoticz settings.
* Fixed a problem where if you have two scripts for a device and one script uses the name and the other uses the id as trigger, the id-based script wasn't executed.

[2.2.0]

* Fixed typo in the doc WActual &gt; WhActual.
* Updated switch adapter to match more switch-like devices.
* Added Z-Wave Thermostat mode device adapter.
* Fixed a problem with thermostat setpoint devices to issue the proper url when updating.
* Added secondsSinceMidnight to time attributes (e.g. lastUpdate.secondsSinceMidnight)
* Added 4 new time-rules: xx minutes before/after sunset/sunrise.
* Added example script to fake user presence.
* Fixed support for uservariables with spaces in their names.
* Show a warning when an item's name isn't unique in the collection.
* Added timing options for security methods armAway, armHome and disarm like device.armAway().afterSec(10).
* Added idx, deviceId and unit to device objects. Don't confuse deviceId with device.id(x) which is actually the index of the device.
* Added instructions on how to create a security panel device in Domoticz. This device now has a state that has the same value as domoticz.security.
* Fixed bug in check battery levels example.
* Fixed some irregularities with dimmer levels.

[2.1.1]

* Fixed typo in the doc WActual &gt; WhActual.
* Updated switch adapter to match more switch-like devices.
* Added Z-Wave Thermostat mode device adapter.
* Fixed a problem with thermostat setpoint devices to issue the proper url when updating.

[2.1.0]

* Added support for switching RGB(W) devices (including Philips/Hue) to have toggleSwitch(), switchOn() and switchOff() and a proper level attribute.
* Added support for Ampère 1 and 3-phase devices
* Added support for leaf wetness devices
* Added support for scale weight devices
* Added support for soil moisture devices
* Added support for sound level devices
* Added support for visibility devices
* Added support for waterflow devices
* Added missing color attribute to alert sensor devices
* Added updateEnergy() to electric usage devices
* Fixed casing for WhTotal, WhActual methods on kWh devices (Watt's in a name?)
* Added toCelsius() helper method to domoticz object as the various update temperature methods all need celsius.
* Added lastLevel for dimmers so you can see the level of the dimmer just before it was switched off (and while is it still on).
* Added integration tests for full round-trip Domoticz &gt; dzVents &gt; Domoticz &gt; dzVents tests (100 tests). Total tests (unit+integration) now counts 395!
* Fixed setting uservariables. It still uses json calls to update the variable in Domoticz otherwise you won't get uservariable event scripts triggered in dzVents.
* Added dzVents version information in the Domoticz settings page for easy checking what dzVents version is being used in your Domoticz built. Eventhough it is integrated with Domoticz, it is handy for dzVents to have it's own heartbeat.
* avg(), avgSince(), sum() and sumSince() now return 0 instead of nil for empty history sets. Makes more sense.
* Fixed boiler example to fallback to the current temperature when there is no history data yet when it calculates the average temperature.
* Use different api command for setting setPoints in the Thermostat setpoint device adapter.

[2.0.0] Domoticz integration

* Almost a complete rewrite.
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': Accessing a device, scene, group, variable, changedDevice, or changedVariable has been changed: instead of doing <code>domoticz.devices['myDevice']</code> you now have to call a function: <code>domoticz.devices('myDevice')</code>. This applies also for the other collections: <code>domoticz.scenes(), domoticz.groups(), domoticz.changedDevices(), domoticz.changedVariables()</code>. If you want to loop over these collection '''you can no longer use the standard Lua for..pairs or for..ipairs construct'''. You have to use the iterators like forEach, filter and reduce: <code>domoticz.devices().forEach(function() .. end)</code> (see [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]]). This was a necessary change to make dzVents a whole lot faster in processing your event scripts. '''So please change your existing dzVents scripts!'''
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': after_sec, for_min, after_min, within_min methods have been renamed to the camel-cased variants afterSec, forMin, afterMin, withinMin. Please rename the calls in your script.
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': There is no longer an option to check if an attribute was changed as this was quite useless. The device has a changed flag. You can use that. Please change your existing scripts.
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': Many device attributes are now in the appropriate type (Number instead of Strings) so you can easily make calculations with them. Units are stripped from the values as much as possible. '''Check your scripts as this may break stuff.'''
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': on-section now requires subsections for <code>devices</code>, <code>timer</code>, <code>variables</code>, and <code>security</code>. The old way no longer works! Please convert your existing scripts!
* '''BREAKING CHANGE''': Make sure that in Domoticz settings under '''Local Networks (no username/password)''' you add <code>127.0.0.1</code> so dzVents can use Domoticz api when needed.
* dzVents now works on Windows machines!
* dzVents is no longer a separate library that you have to get from GitHub. All integrated into Domoticz.
* Added option to create shared utility/helper functions and have them available in all your scripts. Simply add a <code>helpers = { myFunction = function() ... end }</code> to the <code>global_data.lua</code> file in your scripts folder and you can access the function everywhere: <code>domoticz.helpers.myFunction()</code>.
* Created a pluggable system for device adapters so people can easily contribute by creating specific adapters for specific devices. An adapter makes sure that you get the proper methods and attributes for that device. See <code>/path/to/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/runtime/device-adapters</code>.
* Added a <code>reduce()</code> iterator to the collections in the domoticz object so you can now easily collect data about all your devices. See [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]].
* Added a <code>find()</code> iterator so you can easily find an item in one of the collection (devices, scenes, groups etc.). See [[#Looping_through_the_collections:_iterators|Looping through the collections: iterators]].
* Variables (uservariables) have more attributes. The <code>value</code> is now the same type as it is defined in Domoticz. So no more need for a converted nValue attribute. You can inspect the type using <code>myVar.type</code>. If it is a time variable or date variable you an extra <code>date</code> or <code>time</code> attribute with the same methods as with all other date/time related attributes like <code>lastUpdate</code>. .E.g. <code>myVar.date.minutesAgo</code>.
* Settings are now moved to the Domoticz GUI ('''Setup &gt; Settings &gt; Other''') and no longer in a settings file.
* You can now override the log settings per script. So you can turn-off logging globally (see log level in the settings) and still have debug-level logging for that one script you are working on. You can even add a prefix string to the log messages for easy filtering in the Domoticz log. See the documentation about the <code>logging = { .. }</code> section.
* No more need to do http-calls to get extended data from Domoticz. All relevant internal Domoticz state-data is now available inside your dzVents scripts. Thanks Scotty!!
* Support for many many more device types and their specific methods. See the documentation for the list of attributes and events that are available. Note that device-type specific attributes are only available for those type of devices. You will receive an error in the log if you try to access an attribute that doesn't exist for that particular device. Hopefully you don't have to use the rawData table anymore. If you still do please file a report or create a device adapter yourself.
* You can now write dzVents scripts using the internal editor in Domoticz. These scripts will be automatically exported to the filesystem (one-way only) so dzVents can execute them (generated_scripts folder). Thanks again Scotty!
* Support for variable change events (<code>on = { variables = { 'varA', 'varB'} }</code>)
* Support for security change events (<code>on = { security = { domoticz.SECURITY_ARMEDAWAY } }</code>)
* The triggerInfo passed to the execute function now includes information about which security state triggered the script if it was a security event.
* Extended the timer-rule with time range e.g. <code>at 16:45-21:00</code> and <code>at nighttime</code> and <code>at daytime</code> and you can provide a custom function. See documentation for examples. The timer rules can be combined as well.
* Timer rules for <code>every xx minutes</code> or <code>every xx hours</code> are now limited to intervals that will reach *:00 minutes or hours. So for minutes you can only do these intervals: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. Likewise for hours.
* The Time object (e.g. domoticz.time) now has a method <code>matchesRule(rule)</code>. <code>rule</code> is a string same as you use for timer options: <code>if (domoticz.time.matchesRule('at 16:32-21:33 on mon,tue,wed')) then ... end</code>. The rule matches if the current system time matches with the rule.
* A device trigger can have a time-rule constraint: <code>on = { devices = { ['myDevice'] = 'at nighttime' } }</code>. This only triggers the script when myDevice was changed '''and''' the time is after sunset and before sunrise.
* Add support for subsystem selection for domoticz.notify function.
* Fixed a bug where a new persistent variable wasn't picked up when that variable was added to an already existing data section.

[1.1.2]

* More robust way of updating devices.lua
* Added device level information for non-dimmer-like devices

[1.1.1]

* Added support for a devices table in the 'on' section.
* Added extra log level for only showing information about the execution of a script module.
* Added example script for System-alive checker notifications (preventing false negatives).

[1.1]

* Added example script for controlling the temperature in a room with hysteresis control.
* Fixed updateLux (thanks to neutrino)
* Added Kodi commands to the device methods.
* Fixed updateCounter
* Added counterToday and counterTotal attributes for counter devices. Only available when http fetching is enabled.

[1.0.2]

* Added device description attribute.
* Added support for setting the setpoint for opentherm gateway.
* Added timedOut boolean attribute to devices. Requires http data fetching to be anabled.
* Properly detects usage devices and their Wattage.

[1.0.1]

* Added updateCustomSensor(value) method.
* Fixed reset() for historical data.

[1.0][1.0-beta2]

* Deprecated setNew(). Use add() instead. You can now add multiple values at once in a script by calling multiple add()s in succession.
* Fixed printing device logs when a value was boolean or nil
* Fixed WActual/total/today for energy devices.
* Added updateSetPoint method on devices for dummy thermostat devices and EvoHome setpoint devices
* Added couple of helper properties on Time object. See README.
* Renamed the file dzVents_settings.lua to dzVents_settings_example.lua so you don't overwrite your settings when you copy over a new version of dzVents to your system.

[1.0-beta1]

* Added data persistence for scripts between script runs (see readme for more info)
* Added a time-line based data type for you scripts with historical information and many statistical functions for retreiving information like average, minumum, maximum, delta, data smoothing (averaging values over neighbours) etc. See readme for more information.
* Added SMS method to the domoticz object.
* Added toggleSwitch() method to devices that support it.
* Added more switch states that control device.bState (e.g. on == true, open == true 'all on' == true)
* Added secondsAgo to the lastUpdate attribute
* Added tests (test code coverage is above 96%!)
* Refactored code significantly.
* Made sure differently formulated but equal triggers in one script only execute the script only once (like MySensor and MySensor_Temperature).
* Added trigger info as a third parameter (Lua table) that is passed to the execute method of a script containing information about what exactly triggered the script (type = EVENT_TYPE_TIMER/EVENT_TYPE_DEVICE, trigger=<timer rule>). See readme.
* Added Lua time properties to domoticz.time property with all information about the current time (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.)
* Added option to return false in a forEach iteratee function which will abort the forEach loop.
* All devices not delivered by Domoticz to the event scripts are now added to domoticz.devices using the http data that is fetched every 30 minutes (by default).
* Added scenes and groups collections to the domoticz object
* Added Quick Reference Guide.

[0.9.13]

* Fixed some timer functions

[0.9.12]

* Fixed a bug with log level printing. Now errors are printed.
* Added setPoint, heatingMode, lux, WhTotal, WhToday, WActual attributes to devices that support it. No need to access rawData for these anymore.

[0.9.11]

* Added log method to domoticz object. Using this to log message in the Domoticz log will respect the log level setting in the settings file. [dannybloe]
* Updated readme. Better overview, more attributes described.
* Added iterator functions (forEach and filter) to domoticz.devices, domoticz.changedDevices and domoticz.variables to iterate or filter more easily over these collections.
* Added a couple of example scripts.

[0.9.10]

* A little less verbose debug logging. Domoticz seems not to print all message in the log. If there are too many they may get lost. [dannybloe]
* Added method fetchHttpDomoticzData to domoticz object so you can manually trigger getting device information from Domoticz through http. [dannybloe]
* Added support for sounds in domiticz.notify(). [WebStarVenlo]

[0.9.9]

* Fixed a bug where every trigger name was treated as a wild-carded name. Oopsidayzy...

[0.9.8]

* Fixed a bug where a device can have underscores in its name.
* Added dimTo(percentage) method to control dimmers.
* Modified the switch-like commands to allow for timing options: .for_min(), .within_min(), after_sec() and after_min() methods to control delays and durations. Removed the options argument to the switch functions. See readme.
* Added switchSelector method on a device to set a selector switch.
* Added wild-card option for triggers
* Added http request data from Domoticz to devices. Now you can check the battery level and switch type and more. Make sure to edit dzVents_settings.lua file first and check the readme for install instructions!!!
* Added log level setting in dzVents_settings.lua

[0.9.7]

* Added domoticz object resource structure. Updated readme accordingly. No more (or hardly any) need for juggling with all the Domoticz Lua tables and commandArrays.
