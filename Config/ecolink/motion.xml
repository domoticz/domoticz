    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">The sensor must be added to a Z-Wave network prior to use. To include the sensor in a network, both the sensor and the network controller must be in inclusion mode at the same time. 

Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by removing the battery isolation pull tab, or by inserting the battery (see next section for battery installation tips). When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out. If the LED continues to flash repeat the inclusion process.

Refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your specific controller for details on initiating the controller’s inclusion mode. 

	
STEP ONE    	Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.

STEP TWO	Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by removing the battery isolation pull tab, or by inserting the battery (see next section for battery installation tips). When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out.  If the LED continues to flash repeat the inclusion process.   
STEP THREE  	Test the motion sensor before mounting it.  Place the sensor in an unoccupied room.  Leave the room for at least 4 minutes.  Return to the room and pass in front of the sensor lens.  The LED will flash once to indicate that motion was detected.

    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">To restore this sensor to factory default settings, follow the instructions in this manual to exclude this sensor from the Z-Wave network.  Upon completion of removal from the network the sensor will restore itself to factory default settings automatically.  Use this procedure only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</MetaDataItem>

    <MetaDataItem name="Name">EU Z-WAVE PIR MOTION SENSOR</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="WakeupDescription">To save power, this sensor sleeps most of the time and is therefore not awake to receive messages from a gateway for testing. Removing the top case from the sensor will put in device into a tampered mode in which the sensor will stay awake and able to receive messages. Most of the time an end user would not do this, but if the sensor needs to be configured after inclusion, an end user can follow the instructions below for sending Wake-Up notifications.</MetaDataItem>

    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">Exclusion mode on the sensor is initiated following the same exact procedure as inclusion.</MetaDataItem>
