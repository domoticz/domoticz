				When shipped from the factory, the LED is set to turn ON when the connected light is turned OFF. 
				This is the default setting and can be changed if your primary controller supports the node configuration function. 
				To make the LED turn ON when the light is turned ON, change parameter 3s value to 1. 
				To turn the LED OFF at all times, change parameter 3s value to 2.
