                Defines if the outputs are controlled individually, as a traditional device with two channels, or if its behaviour simulates a single pole double throw relay.
                0 - SINGLE CHANNELS (Default Value) => Channel 1 and Channel 2 are controlled individually.
                From 1 to 9 - SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW RELAY => The two channels are in opposite status. If the Channel 1 is close the Channel 2 is open, if the Channel 1 is open the Channel 2 is close. The value of the parameter defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds
                From 10 to 19 - SEQUENCING RELAY => Channels are toggled in this way: both channels ON, only channel 1 ON, only channel 2 ON, both channels OFF. The value of the parameter, deducted of 9, defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds.
                From 20 to 39 - SELECTOR => Both channels can be OFF but they can never be ON simultaneously. It can be used for fan coil control, roller shutters, and in general for two-speed systems. The value of the parameter, deducted of 19, defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds.
