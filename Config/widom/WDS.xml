    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">Only a controller can remove a device from the network. WiDom Universal Double Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave certified controllers. After the exclusion procedure has been activated by the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in Exclusion Mode by three consecutive clicks on the (B) button or on the external switch, when available.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">The device can be reset ot the factory reset by six consecutive clicks. This procedure shuld be used only if the primary controller is missing or inoperable.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, a single click on the (B) button or on one of the external switches will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched lasting a variable amount of time between 15-30 seconds.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="Description">Universal Double Switch is the ON/OFF smallest control device in the world designed to independently control two separate loads, suited for use as both a local and remote switch. Similarly to the other WiDom “in wall” devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviours to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.
Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Universal Double Switch also boasts the lowest energy consumption on the market.
At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.
Thanks to the framework developed by WiDom, the various types of “events” on the “External Switch” can be recognised and associated to actions to be performed on the device, on any associated devices, on all devices on the network.</MetaDataItem>

                Defines if the outputs are controlled individually, as a traditional device with two channels, or if its behaviour simulates a single pole double throw relay.
                0 - SINGLE CHANNELS (Default Value) => Channel 1 and Channel 2 are controlled individually.
                From 1 to 9 - SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW RELAY => The two channels are in opposite status. If the Channel 1 is close the Channel 2 is open, if the Channel 1 is open the Channel 2 is close. The value of the parameter defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds
                From 10 to 19 - SEQUENCING RELAY => Channels are toggled in this way: both channels ON, only channel 1 ON, only channel 2 ON, both channels OFF. The value of the parameter, deducted of 9, defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds.
                From 20 to 39 - SELECTOR => Both channels can be OFF but they can never be ON simultaneously. It can be used for fan coil control, roller shutters, and in general for two-speed systems. The value of the parameter, deducted of 19, defines the closing delay of the relay in tenth of seconds.
