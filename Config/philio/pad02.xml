    <MetaDataItem name="Description">PAD02 is an E27(EU)/ E26(US) Edison screw based lamp socket, which provides electrical connection to the E14(EU)/ E12(US) Edison screw based lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of socket allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced. You can On/Off the light by pressing the button briefly, or a long pressing to control the brightness of dimmable lightbulb. 
This dimmer is a transceiver which is a security enabled device which based on Z-Wave Plus technology. Z-Wave PlusTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave PlusTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z- WaveTM enabled networks. Remote dim level control of the connected light is possible with other manufacturer’s wireless Controller. Since PAD02 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with a Secured enabled controller to fully utilize the device. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device. 

Adding to Z- WaveTM  Network 
In the front casing, there is an on/off button with LED indicator below which is used to switch on and off, dim level, or carries out add, remove, reset or association. When first power is applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion. 

Auto Inclusion
The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the dimmer does not have Node ID and just connect the dimmer to main power. Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once every several seconds. Unlike “inclusion” function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On/Off button on the dimmer.
