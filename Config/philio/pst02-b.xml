    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">There are two tamper keys in the device, one is in the back side,
another is in the front side. Both of them can add, remove or reset from Z-WaveTM network.
1. Have Z-WaveTM Controller entered inclusion mode.
2. Pressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds
to enter the inclusion mode.
3. After add successful, the device will wake to
receive the setting command from Z-WaveTM
Controller about 20 seconds

    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">1. Pressing tamper key four times within 1.5 seconds
and do not release the tamper key in the 4th
pressed, and the LED will light ON.
2. After 3 seconds the LED will turn OFF, after that
within 2 seconds, release the tamper key. If
successful, the LED will light ON one second.
Otherwise, the LED will flash once.
3. IDs are excluded and all settings will reset to
factory default.

*Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="WakeupDescription">After the device adding to the network, it will wake-up once per day in
default. When it wake-up it will broadcast the “Wake Up Notification”
message to the network, and wake-up 10 seconds for receive the
setting commands.
The wake-up interval minimum setting is 30 minutes, and maximum
setting is 120 hours. And the interval step is 30 minutes.
If the user want to wake-up the device immediately, please remove the
front cover,and press the tamper key once. The device will wake-up 10
seconds.</MetaDataItem>

    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The slim multisensorPST02-5B has PIR, temperature and illumination, 3 sensors function in one,based on Z-Wave technology
It is the Z-WaveTM plus product, it support the security, OTA... Those
newest features of the Z-WaveTM technology. Z-WaveTM is a wireless
communication protocol designed for home automation, specifically to
remotely control applications in residential and light commercial
environments. The technology uses a low-power RF radio embedded or
retrofitted into home electronics devices and systems, such as lighting,
home access control, entertainment systems and household appliances.</MetaDataItem>
