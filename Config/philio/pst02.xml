          PIR sensitivity settings. 
          0 means disable the PIR motion. 
          1 means the lowest sensitivity, 
          99 means the highest sensitivity. 
          High sensitivity means can detected long distance, but if there is more noise signal in the environment, it will re-trigger too frequency.
