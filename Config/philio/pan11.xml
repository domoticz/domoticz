    <MetaDataItem name="Description">This plug-in ON/OFF switch PAN11 is a security enabled wireless switch, based on Z-Wave Plus technology. Z-Wave PlusTM enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave PlusTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-WaveTM enabled networks. Remote On/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer’s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended  destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because PAN11 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device. 
 
This  plug-in  ON/OFF  switch  is  able  to  detect  instance  wattage  (3000W/CE/CN, 1560W/UL/TW/JP)  and  overload  current  (14.5A  with  resistive  load)  of  connected lights or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Switch will be disabled and its On/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, unplug and re-connect the switch will reset its overload condition to normal status. 

Adding to Z-WaveTM Network 

In the front casing, there is an On/Off button with LED indicator which is used to toggle switch on  and off or carry  out  inclusion,  exclusion, reset or  association. When first power is applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion.  

Auto Inclusion 

The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the switch does not have Node ID and just plug the switch into a wall outlet. 

Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once several seconds. Unlike “inclusion” function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On/Off button on the Switch.
