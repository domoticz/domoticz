    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">1.Put your Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode by following the instructions provided by the controller manufacturer. 
2.Pressing Include button of PAN05 three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode. 
3.Node ID has been excluded.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="Description">This in-wall switch module is a transceiver which is a security enabled device which based on Z-Wave Plus technology, and it is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Mini size design let the module can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration. Since PAN05 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device. 
There are many kind of application by using the module to switch Load On and Off, one main application is the light control. If connect the COM terminal directly to AC Line terminal, the new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of light like incandescent, fluorescent and LED light. This module can also connect to alternative power supply like DC 12V to switch on/off 12V MR-16 light.

Adding to Z-WaveTM Network 
In the front casing, there is an on/off button with LED indicator below which is used to toggle switch on and off or carries out add, remove, reset or association. When first power applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion. 

Auto Inclusion 
The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the in wall switch does not have Node ID and just connect the switch to main power. 
Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once every several seconds. Unlike “Add” function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On/Off button on the Switch. </MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">1.Put your Z-Wave controller into inclusion mode by following the instructions provided by the controller manufacturer. 
2.Pressing Include button of PAN05 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode. </MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">Use this procedure only in the event that the primary controller is lost or otherwise inoperable.
1.Pressing Include button of PAN05 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode. 
2.Within 1 second, press Include button of PAN05 again for 5 seconds. 
3.IDs are excluded. </MetaDataItem>

      <Help>To match different kind of external switches, the inputs S1 and S2 can be set to either Edge Mode, Pulse Mode or Edge/Toggle Mode. Edge Mode: The Position of the external switch determines the switching state of the relay. After a wireless switching command it may be needed to operate the switch twice to return to the direct relation of switch position and relay state. Toggle Mode: Each ON-Position of the external switch will toggle the state of the relays. This mode is particularly suited for mono-stable switches. Edge/Toggle-Mode: Every change of the state of the external switch results in a change of the relay state. Default setting: Edge Mode</Help>
