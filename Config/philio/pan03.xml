		<Value type="short" instance="1" index="1" genre="config" label="Watt meter report period" min="1" max="32767" value="720">
			<Help>If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value =720), the device will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to Z-Wave Controller. Unit: 5 seconds.</Help>
		</Value>

		<Value type="short" instance="1" index="2" genre="config" label="kWh meter report period" min="1" max="32767" value="6">
			<Help>If the setting is configured for 1hour (set value =6), the Micromodule will report its Accumulated Power Consumption (KW/h) every 1 hour to Z-Wave Controller. 10min.</Help>

			<Help>Manual switch S1 and S2 can set to Edge mode or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode, default value is Edge mode.
				1: EDGE MODE: This mode is suitable for the bi-stable wall switch that has indicator point on the switch, and the same position correspond to same state of relay1. If the Micromodule relay change the state because of receiving Z-Wave RF command, it may need two times of change (switch on to off or switch off to on) to let relay back to the correspond state. Manual switch S2 is disabled in this mode. 
				2: PULSE MODE: This mode is suitable for the toggle type wall switch to swap the state of Relay1. 
				3 :EDGE-TOGGLE MODE: This mode is suitable for the normal bi-stable switch, wheneverchange the state of the wall switch will also swap the state of Relay1.</Help>
