    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The wireless plug socket PSC234ZW allows you to remotely control electrical appliances. It features a metering function to measure the power consumption and the accumulated energy usage of connected equipment. The built-in metering unit is of high quality: it calculates the true-power and also works for small loads from 1W upwards. This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.
The PSC234ZW has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.
Additionally the PSC234 has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current. This leads to a very high number of possible switching cycles also for difficult loads like led-lamps or motors, e.g. pumps.

1) hold the touch-button until the led 
    shows red light
2) release the touch-button and hold the 
    touch-button again until the led starts 
    to flash green
The PSC234 confirms the successful completion of the factory reset procedure by steady red flashing.

    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">When a PSC234 that is not associated to a Z-Wave network, is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashed followed by steady red flashing. The PSC234 can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:
1) start inclusion/exclusion on the primary 
    controller
2) hold the touch button until the led  
    shows green light
3) release the touch button
 The PSC234 will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.</MetaDataItem>

The PSC234 can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:
1) start inclusion/exclusion on the primary 
    controller
2) hold the touch button until the led  
    shows green light
3) release the touch button
The PSC234 will confirm successful addition to the network by 5 green flashes.
The PSC234 will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.
