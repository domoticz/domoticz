    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">When a PS132ZW that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. The PSC132ZW can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:
1) start inclusion/exclusion on the primary 
    controller
2) hold the touch button until the led  
    shows green light
3) release the touch button
The PSC234 will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.

    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The wireless flush-mount switching actuator PSC132ZW allows you to remotely control electrical appliances. It features a metering function to measure the power consumption and the accumulated energy usage of connected equipment. The built-in metering unit is of high quality: it calculates the true-power and also works for small loads from 1W upwards. This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.
The PSC132ZW has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.
Additionally the PSC132 has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current. This leads to a very high number of possible switching cycles also for difficult loads like led-lamps or motors, e.g. pumps.

    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">Please use this procedure only if the primary controller is missing or inoperable:
The device can be put into factory default state manually by the following procedure:
1) hold the touch-button until the led 
    shows red light
2) release the touch-button and hold the 
    touch-button again until the led starts 
    to flash green
The PSC132ZW confirms the successful completion of the factory reset procedure by steady red flashing.
