    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">Leviton Decora Smart™ Z-Wave® devices support two methods of inclusion. When using a Z-Wave Plus® certified controller choose Network Wide Inclusion.
Network Wide Inclusion:
Network Wide Inclusion allows your device to be included into the network using devices already in the network to assist with communication. Work your way from the closest devices to the controller outward.
• Enter Programming Mode by holding the top of the paddle for 7 seconds, the Locator LED will blink amber.
• Tap the top of the paddle one time.
The Locator LED will quickly flash green.
• The Decora Smart™ Z-Wave® device is ready to learn into the Z-Wave® network.
• Follow directions in the Z-Wave controller to complete the adding process.
• Upon successful addition to network the LED will turn off and then blink green 3 times.
• If the adding process is not successful the LED will flash red 3 times.
Traditional Inclusion:
For older controllers Traditional Inclusion is supported. Depending on the age of the controller the controller will need to be 3 to 35 feet from the device when including.
• Enter Programming Mode by holding the top of the paddle for 7 seconds, the Locator LED will blink amber.
• The Decora SmartTM Z-Wave® device is ready to add to the Z-Wave® network.
• Follow directions in the Z-Wave® controller to enter learn mode.
• Tap the top of the paddle one time. The Locator LED will quickly flash green. The Z-Wave® controller will begin to pair with the Decora Smart™ device.
• Upon successful addition to the network the LED will turn off and then blink green 3 times.
• If the adding process is not successful the LED will flash red 3 times.
