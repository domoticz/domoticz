    <MetaDataItem name="WakeupDescription">There are two tamper keys in the device, one is in the back side, another is in the front side.  Both of them  can add,  remove, reset or association from Z-Wave network.
Press any key once, the device will awake 10 seconds.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The mydlink Z-Wave Motion Sensor DCH-Z120 has PIR, temperature and illumination, 3 sensors function in one,based on Z-Wave technology.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">There are two tamper keys in the device, one is in the back side, another is in the front side.  Both of them  can add,  remove, reset or association from Z-Wave network.
To add into a Z-Wave network: 
1. Have Z-Wave  Controller entered inclusion mode.
2. Pressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds to enter the inclusion mode.
3. After add successful, the device will wake to receive the setting command from Z-Wave Controller about 20 seconds.</MetaDataItem>

    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">There are two tamper keys in the device, one is in the back side, another is in the front side.  Both of them  can add,  remove, reset or association from Z-Wave network.
To reset the device: 
Notice: Use this procedure only in the event that the primary controller is lost or otherwise inoperable.
1. Pressing tamper key four times within 1.5 seconds and do not release the tamper key in the 4th  pressed, and the LED will light ON.
2. After 3 seconds the LED will turn OFF, after that within 2 seconds, release the tamper key. If successful, the LED will light ON one second. Otherwise, the LED will flash once.
3. IDs are excluded and all settings will reset to factory default.</MetaDataItem>

    <Value genre="config" index="2" label="Basic Set Level" max="255" min="0" type="byte" value="255">
      <Help>
          Set the BASIC command value to turn on the light.
          255: always turn on the light. 
          For dimmer equipment 1 to 100 means the light strength. 0 means turn off the light.

    <Value genre="config" index="3" label="PIR Sensitivity" max="99" min="0" type="byte" value="80">
      <Help>
          PIR sensitivity settings.
          0 means disable the PIR motion.
          1 means the lowest sensitivity.
          99 means the highest sensitivity.
          High sensitivity means the sensor can detect over a long distance, but if there is more noise signal in the environment, it will re-trigger too frequently.

    <Value genre="config" index="4" label="Light threshold" max="100" min="0" type="byte" value="99">
      <Help>
          Set the illumination threshold to turn on the light. When the event is triggered and the environment illumination is lower than the threshold, the device will turn on the light.
          0 means turn off illumination detected function and never turn on the light.
          1 means darkest.
          99 means brightest.
          100 means turn off illumination detected function. And always turn on the light.
          * Notice * in none test mode, only the value in 1 to 99 will enable the illumination detected function and update the illumination value.
