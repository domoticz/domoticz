      <Help>
          PIR sensitivity settings.
          0 means disable the PIR motion.
          1 means the lowest sensitivity.
          99 means the highest sensitivity.
          High sensitivity means the sensor can detect over a long distance, but if there is more noise signal in the environment, it will re-trigger too frequently.

      <Help>
          Set the illumination threshold to turn on the light. When the event is triggered and the environment illumination is lower than the threshold, the device will turn on the light.
          0 means turn off illumination detected function and never turn on the light.
          1 means darkest.
          99 means brightest.
          100 means turn off illumination detected function. And always turn on the light.
          * Notice * in none test mode, only the value in 1 to 99 will enable the illumination detected function and update the illumination value.
