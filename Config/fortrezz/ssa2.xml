			<Help>
				Delay, from the time the siren-strobe turns on, before the Basic Set Off command is accepted.
				This could be used, for example, to avoid the situation where an associated window/door sensor turns the SSA1 alarm on and then immediately off when the window/door is opened and then quickly closed.
				-128 seconds to -1 seconds -> Interpreted as unsigned integer for negative values sent in set command.
