    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The SSR 303 is a single channel relay/switch, it forms part of central heating control system, it can be operated by any third party controllers/Thermostat using ‘Binary Switch CC’ commands.

SSR 303 will act as a repeater once added into the Z- Wave network, providing an alternative communication route for units which otherwise would not be within communication distance of each other.

SSR 303 has a fail-safe mode where by the relay is turned OFF if another 'Thermostat Mode SET' command has not been received within 60 minutes.</MetaDataItem>
