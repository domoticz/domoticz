    <MetaDataItem name="Name">Z-Wave Multi-Sensor HSM200</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="ExclusionDescription">There are two methods for exclusion:
1) Put the controller into exclusion mode, then press and release the push button on the side of the HSM200. The LED will blink aqua when no longer joined to the network.
2) (Use this procedure only when your primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.)  Press and hold the push button. The LED will blink blue faster and faster and then shift to yellow and continue to blink faster and faster. Once the LED goes out, the HSM200 is reset to the factory defaults and will blink aqua.
Method 1 is recommended. Method 2 should only to be used in the event that the primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">When the HSM200 has not yet been joined to a Z-Wave network, the LED blinks aqua.

To Include: Put the controller into learn mode, (in the HomeSeer Z-Wave Plug-in, choose controller functions and add/include device.) then press and release the push button on the side of the HSM200. The LED will blink blue while the HSM200 is trying to join the Z-Wave network.  Once joined to the network, the HSM200 enters a motion sensor test mode and the LED will blink white each time motion is detected. This mode lasts for about 5 minutes and then the LED will go out.
If the HSM200 is unable to join the network, it will return to blinking aqua.</MetaDataItem>
    <MetaDataItem name="ResetDescription">Excluding from a Z-Wave network will return the device to factory defaults. See the Product Exclusion Description for details.

    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The HSM200 senses motion, temperature and light level, can function as a night light, and can also be programmed to display up to 7 different glowing colors when things happen in the home!
 
Since the HSM200 is line powered, there are no batteries to change and the unit automatically operates as a Z-Wave network repeater.  Installation is fast and easy. Just plug into any available 120v outlet and tap the button on the side to join it to your Z-Wave network.
 
HSM200 is compatible with any HomeSeer HS3-based system, including the full line of HomeTrollers, and Z-Wave systems from 3rd parties.  HomeSeer users can create events to display different colors when motion is sensed, doors are opened, water leaks are detected or just about anything else happens in the home. Color options  include red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan and white. The unit can also be programmed to work as a night light after hours.</MetaDataItem>

      <Help>
				On Time sets the number of minutes that the lights stay on when
				motion has not been detected.
				A value of 0 On Time is a special mode where the lights are
				constantly sent a command to turn them on whenever motion is
				detected. The device will NOT turn the lights off in this mode.
				Note that this mode will significantly shorten battery life.
				Recommended values:
				5 min for hallways.
				20 min for an office environment.
				60 min for a library or other room where someone may be sitting
				still for a long time.
				This may be inaccurate, but default for Homeseer HSM100 may actually be 3 minutes, instead of 20?

      <Help>
				OnLevel is the value sent by the Z-Wave BASIC_SET command to all Association Group 2 nodes when motion is detected. 
				A value of 0 will turn the lights off (not recommended).
				A value between 1 and 99 will set the dim level to between 1% and 99% (99% is full on).
				A value of -1 will turn the light on which depends on the device but most will set the dim level to the last dim setting.

				TempAdj. TempAdj is a twos-complement number that is used to adjust the temperature reading to make it more accurate. The value is in tenths of degree Fahrenheit. The temperature reading can be adjusted by +12.7F to -12.8F. A value of 1 will adjust the temperature reading by +0.1F. A value of -1 will adjust the temperature by -0.1F. A value of 123 will adjust the temperature by +12.3F.
