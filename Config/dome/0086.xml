    <MetaDataItem name="Description">The Dome™ Home Automation DMMZ1 Mouser is a powerful rodent electric trap with Z-Wave technology built-in. It kills mice, rats and other rodents quickly, cleanly and humanely with a powerful jolt of electricity. Simply set bait, turn on and place in desired location. When connected to Z-Wave Certified Hub, once the trap is full, it sends out a notification to your smarthome system. You can easily dispose of Mouser’s contents without ever having to touch them. Use the top handle and tip to dispose of caught rodents. Specially designed removable and washable bait tray will allow you to easily replace the bait and set it back up. It operates on 4 AA batteries (not included) and is optimised to last over 50 uses. Mouser features extra-long Z-Wave wireless range (up to 150 ft) and  Dome™ DMMZ1 Mouser comes with a 1-year limited warranty. Measurements in inches: 8.75 x 4.5 x 5.
