	/** \brief
	 *   The main public interface to OpenZWave.
	 *
	 *	 \nosubgrouping
	 *   A singleton class providing the main public interface to OpenZWave.
	 *   The Manager class exposes all the functionality required to add
	 *   Z-Wave support to an application.  It handles the sending and receiving
	 *   of Z-Wave messages as well as the configuration of a Z-Wave network
	 *   and its devices, freeing the library user from the burden of learning
	 *   the low-level details of the Z-Wave protocol.
	 *   <p>
	 *   All Z-Wave functionality is accessed via the Manager class.  While this
	 *   does not make for the most efficient code structure, it does enable
	 *   the library to handle potentially complex and hard-to-debug issues
	 *   such as multi-threading and object lifespans behind the scenes.
	 *   Application development is therefore simplified and less prone to bugs.
	 *   <p>
	 *   There can be only one instance of the Manager class, and all applications
	 *   will start by calling Manager::Create static method to create that instance.
	 *   From then on, a call to the Manager::Get static method will return the
	 *   pointer to the Manager object.  On application exit, Manager::Destroy
	 *   should be called to allow OpenZWave to clean up and delete any other
	 *   objects it has created.
	 *   <p>
	 *   Once the Manager has been created, a call should be made to Manager::AddWatcher
	 *   to install a notification callback handler.  This handler will receive
	 *   notifications of Z-Wave network changes and updates to device values, and is
	 *   an essential element of OpenZWave.
 	 *   <p>
	 *   Next, a call should be made to Manager::AddDriver for each Z-Wave controller
	 *   attached to the PC.  Each Driver will handle the sending and receiving of
	 *   messages for all the devices in its controller's Z-Wave network.  The Driver
	 *   will read any previously saved configuration and then query the Z-Wave controller
	 *   for any missing information.  Once that process is complete, a DriverReady
	 *   notification callback will be sent containing the Home ID of the controller,
	 *   which is required by most of the other Manager class methods.
	 *	 <p>
	 *	 [After the DriverReady notification is sent, the Driver will poll each node on
	 *   the network to update information about each node.  After all "awake" nodes
	 *   have been polled, an "AllAwakeNodesQueried" notification is sent.  This is when
	 *   a client application can expect all of the node information (both static
	 *   information, like the physical device's capabilities, session information
	 *   (like [associations and/or names] and dynamic information (like temperature or
	 *   on/off state) to be available.  Finally, after all nodes (whether listening or
	 *   sleeping) have been polled, an "AllNodesQueried" notification is sent.]
