/* GENERAL SETTINGS
Welcome the theme settings.

First, you can (add or) remove features by simply adding (or removing) /* at the beginning of the 
lines at the top of this page. Or you can just delete the line. But don't change the order. */



/* CUSTOM BACKGROUND IMAGE
You can add your own background image here. Just place the URL between the brackets of "url()" in the line below, and 
remove the /* before the word 'body'. This will override the detault background image. */


/* body {
    background: transparent url() center center fixed;
    background-size: cover;
}


*//* FEATURE DETAILS


__Show Version Number__
This permanently shows the Domoticz version number, not just on mouse-over.

__Dashboard Move Sun__
This moves the sun-up and sun-down times indicator to the footer.



ITEM GRID CHANGES

__Dashboard_Masonry__
Makes items of various sizes fit together better on the screen. You pay a price: re-ordering items stil works, but it 
becomes unpredictable, as the algorithm makes the final choice on how items can best fit. It also freaks out the 
dragging visualisation.
 (!) This feature is currently waiting for some changes to Domoticz.

__Dashboard Vertical Columns__
This feature will create vertical columns on your dashboard, one for each sensor type. BUT this feature only 
springs into action if you have enough horizontal space for the amount device-types that you have. So for 5 columns 
you need at least a 1300 pixels wide screen, for example. This feature works for both the normal and compact display 
option.
 (!) This feature is currently waiting for some changes to Domoticz.

__Variable items per row__
On narrower screens you get 2 items per row. On wider screens you can get 4, 5 or even 8, depending on the available 
space, and if you have selected "normal" or "compact" in the settings.
This will only work if you have a modern browser (CSS3), as it needs some modification to the output via javascript.
 (!) This feature is currently waiting for some changes to Domoticz.



ITEM DISPLAY CHANGES

__Thinner Items on Wide Screens__ 
If you have a really really wide screen, then this can be useful. It takes the item's buttons, and moves them in line 
with the name. Only use this in combination with Vertical Columns if your screen is really really big. 
Don't use this in combination with Variable Items Per Row.

__Dashboard Highlights__
This is a little CSS script that super-sizes the first three items for each category. You can use this to highlight 
some of your devices, or give their buttons a little more breathing room. This only works for the normal view, 
because the compact view is about saving space. This can be combined with Vertical Columns, but will create some 
strange behaviour if you have selected Variable Items Per Row, as it only enlarges the first three items of each 
category (for now).

__Dashboard See-Through Highlights__
This makes the background of items see-through. This can look nice if you use your own background images.

__Dashboard Show Last Update__
Enable this if you want items on the dashboard to also display the time they were last updated.



MENU OPTIONS

__Navigation Main Sidemenu__
This moves the main menu to the left side of the screen. It works best for wide screens (about 980 pixels wide 
is my recommendation). It is automatically disabled for mobile phones.

__Settings Sidemenu__
Instead of the tabs at the top of each settings page, you get a sidebar instead. It stays in place. This 
includes the 'save' button, so you always have easy access to that. Works well with both the menu at the top or the 
side menu.

__Settings Fixed Tabs__
This fixes the settings tabs at the top of the screen, so they stay available even when you scroll. Only use this in 
combination with the main sidebar menu. Don't combine with the settings side-menu.



EXTRA OPTIONS

__Dashboard Data Visualizations__
An experimental feature where javascript overlays a datavisualisation for certain items. Percentages get visualised. 
Some items, like temperature, even get complete charts for the past 24 hours. The data is pruned, so the 
vizualisation isn't very precise. But it's good enough.


__Center Popups__
Sometimes items that pop-up, like colour selectors or thermostat setpoints, go off the screen. This forces them 
to be in the middle of the screen. Useful on smaller screens.

__Extra's and Animations__
Adds some pretty details like switch-checkboxes in settings, barometer backgrounds and animations, and more.
