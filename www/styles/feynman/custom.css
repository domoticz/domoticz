/* GENERAL SETTINGS
Welcome the Feynman theme settings.

First, you can (add or) remove features by simply adding (or removing) /* at the beginning of the 
lines at the top of this page. Or you can just delete the line.


/* CUSTOM BACKGROUND IMAGE
You can add your own background image here. Just place the URL between the brackets of "url()" in the line below, and 
remove the /* before the word 'body'. This will override the detault background image.
*/

/* body {
    background: url() no-repeat center center fixed;
}


*//* FEATURE DETAILS

__Dashboard Highlights__
This is a little CSS script that super-sizes the first three items for each category. You can use this to highlight 
some of your devices, or give their buttons a little more breathing room. This only works for the normal view, 
because the compact view is about saving space. This can be combined with Vertical Columns.

__Dashboard See-Through Highlights__
This makes the background of items see-through. This can look nice if you use your own background images.

__Dashboard Vertical Columns__
This feature will create vertical columns on your dashboard, one for each sensor type. BUT this feature only 
springs into action if you have enough horizontal space for the amount device-types that you have. So for 5 columns 
you need at least a 1300 pixels wide screen, for example. This feature works for both the normal and compact display option.
 (!) This feature is currently waiting for some changes to Domoticz.

__Navigation Main Sidemenu__
This moves the main menu to the left side of the screen. It works best for wide screens (about 980 pixels wide 
is my recommendation). It is automatically disabled for mobile phones.

__Settings Sidemenu__
Instead of the tabs at the top of each settings page, you get a sidebar instead. It stays in place. This 
includes the 'save' button, so you always have easy access to that.

__Extra's and Animations__
Adds some pretty details (checkboxes) and animations (dialog pop-ups).
