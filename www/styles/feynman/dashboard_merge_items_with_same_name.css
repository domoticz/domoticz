/* This is an experimental feature that merges items that have the same name before a dash, and then takes the part after that dash as the senser output name.

So:
MiFlora plant 1 - Moisture
MiFlora plant 1 - Light level
MiFlora plant 1 - fertility

..would be merged into one item with the new name "MiFlora", and all the values would become its status outputs.

The feature will also only merge items with just one data value.
