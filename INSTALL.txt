
Usage: Domoticz [-www <port>]  [-verbose <0|1>]
                -www <port>   Default is: -www 8080
                -verbose <0|1> (0 is none, 1 is debug)   Default is: -verbose 0
Examples:
                Domoticz            (this is the same as Domoticz -www 8080 -verbose 0)
				Domoticz -www 81 -verbose 1

If Domoticz and the browser are running on the same system you can connect with http://localhost:8080/
To stop the application: press Ctrl-C in the application screen (not in the browser)

Compatible browsers:
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari...
- Internet Explorer version 10+

Be aware that a Raspberry pi receives its time from an online ntp server.
If the pi is not connected to a network, the device time will not be updated, resulting in scheduling issues. 

All ports below 1024 on linux systems can only be started by root.
If you run domoticz on port 80, make sure to run it as root, e.g. : sudo ./domoticz

Compiling from source code:
------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: (or in other words, setup your compile enviroment): 

All:
(Assuming domoticz development is in a subfolder of the user)
cd ~

[OpenZWave support]
If you need support for Open-ZWave (for example if you want to use an Aeon USB V2 zwave adapter),
you need to compile open zwave
- Compile OpenZWave (http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/)
(On non-darwin install libudev-dev (sudo apt-get install libudev-dev)
svn co http://open-zwave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-zwave-read-only
cd open-zwave-read-only

[Tellstick support]
If you need support for Tellstick or Tellstic Duo (http://www.telldus.se/products/range) you need to install telldus-core before compileing. 
On systems with apt package manger (like ubuntu and Raspbian) telldus-core can be installed by doing the following:
 * Add "deb http://download.telldus.com/debian/ stable main" to the file /etc/apt/sources.list
 * Run:
   * wget -q http://download.telldus.se/debian/telldus-public.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   * sudo apt-get update
   * sudo apt-get install libtelldus-core-dev

[Siemens S7 PLC support]
if you need support for Siemens S7 PLC, you need to install the snap 7 library in the build root
Download snap7-full-1.3.0 from http://snap7.sourceforge.net/ and extract the the relevant library in the build root.

To use a plc, modify the file S7-config.yaml in the working directory of domoticz. 
In this file you can list all devices. A device has an offset, this is the first bit it uses in the plc memory. 
It can be of type lamp or dimmer. A lamp is one bit long, 0 for off, 1 for on. A dimmer is 16 bit long, 0 for off.  


|* Darwin (Mac)
|There is a problem in the MakeFile, change the DEBUG/RELEASE defines with:
|DEBUG_CFLAGS    := -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-inline -Werror -Wno-self-assign -Wno-unused-private-field -Wno-format -g -DDEBUG -DLOG_STDERR -fPIC
|RELEASE_CFLAGS  := -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Werror -Wno-self-assign -Wno-unused-private-field -Wno-format -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC
|
|Also you need to add the following at the top of the files ../../src/platform/unix/LogImpl.cpp and ../../src/platform/unix/SerialControllerImpl.cpp
|
|#include <pthread.h>
|

make


[Windows]
- You need Visual Studio 2015 (community edition is OK)
- The project file for Visual Studio can be found inside the "msbuild" folder
- You need to download and unpack the following archive inside the "msbuild" folder:
  http://www.domoticz.com/WindowsLibraries.7z

[Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi (wheezy)]
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev libsqlite3-dev subversion curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libusb-dev libudev-dev zlib1g-dev

Raspberry Pi (wheezy, 22 November 2012): (First time compile time: 25 minutes)
At this moment (First generation RPi (128MB) (And possible the last generation too), there is a issue with the FTDI drivers (USB).
A quick fix it to add the following in front of /boot/cmdline.txt
dwc_otg.speed=1
This will cause the USB to switch back to version 1.1, but also the network speed is reduced a lot! (not that i want to use 80mbps)
When using the Arch Linux image, it looks like you do not have to apply the above fix.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Raspberry Pi (Arch Linux)]
sudo pacman -S gcc cmake subversion boost sqlite make curl libusb libudev-dev

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Debian (Mac OS)]
Mac OS Installation:
Prerequistics:
- XCode with Command Line Tools
- macports

sudo port install cmake
sudo port install boost
sudo port install libusb
sudo port install libusb-compat
sudo port install libudev-dev
sudo port install zlib1g-dev

[Synology: (Initial setup time is 30 minutes, DSM 5.1+/tested with 212+)]

Getting the source code:
git clone https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz.git domoticz

cd domoticz

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release CMakeLists.txt
make

now you should have the binary application, you can start it with
./domoticz

For additional parameters type:
./domoticz -h

Note: Compiling on the Raspberry Pi will take about 15 minutes

To Update to a newer version:
- stop the application (control-c), or stop the startup script (see below) with /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh stop

(from the domoticz folder)

git pull
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make

Unix startup script:
To start Domoticz automatically when the system starts perform the following steps:

sudo cp domoticz.sh /etc/init.d
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh
sudo update-rc.d domoticz.sh defaults

Edit the startup script and point the DEAMON location to point to the installation folder:
sudo vi /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh

DAEMON=/home/pi/domoticz/domoticz

If you want to use another web interface port change:

OPTIONS="-www 8080"

You can now start domoticz with:
sudo /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh start

To stop:
sudo /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh stop

To check if domoticz is running:
sudo /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh status

If your system supports it you can also do
sudo service domoticz.sh start
sudo service domoticz.sh stop
sudo service domoticz.sh status

To update when you have installed it as startup service:
cd /home/pi/domoticz (or where you installed domoticz)
sudo service domoticz.sh stop
git pull
make
sudo service domoticz.sh start

Option: Create an update and backup script
chmod +x updatedomo

To update domoticz

login to your Raspberry Pi
cd domoticz
./updatedomo
