 * Topic: Threads

/***************************************************
 * Important note
 *
 * The following functions that deal with network operations will return
 * MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, but this does not mean that the operation has
 * taken place. An attempt will be made to write the network data, but if the
 * socket is not available for writing at that time then the packet will not be
 * sent. To ensure the packet is sent, call mosquitto_loop() (which must also
 * be called to process incoming network data).
 * This is especially important when disconnecting a client that has a will. If
 * the broker does not receive the DISCONNECT command, it will assume that the
 * client has disconnected unexpectedly and send the will.

 * If you set `host` to `example.com`, then this call will attempt to retrieve
 * the DNS SRV record for `_secure-mqtt._tcp.example.com` or
 * `_mqtt._tcp.example.com` to discover which actual host to connect to.
 *
 * DNS SRV support is not usually compiled in to libmosquitto, use of this call
 * is not recommended.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	mosq -         a valid mosquitto instance.
 * 	host -         the hostname to search for an SRV record.
 * 	keepalive -    the number of seconds after which the broker should send a PING
 *                 message to the client if no other messages have been exchanged
 *                 in that time.
 *  bind_address - the hostname or ip address of the local network interface to
 *                 bind to.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS - on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -   if the input parameters were invalid.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_ERRNO -   if a system call returned an error. The variable errno
 *                     contains the error code, even on Windows.
 *                     Use strerror_r() where available or FormatMessage() on
 *                     Windows.

 * suitable for the situation where you only want to handle incoming messages

 * If the server you are connecting to requires clients to provide a
 * certificate, define certfile and keyfile with your client certificate and
 * private key. If your private key is encrypted, provide a password callback
 * function or you will have to enter the password at the command line.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  mosq -        a valid mosquitto instance.
 *  cafile -      path to a file containing the PEM encoded trusted CA
 *                certificate files. Either cafile or capath must not be NULL.
 *  capath -      path to a directory containing the PEM encoded trusted CA
 *                certificate files. See mosquitto.conf for more details on
 *                configuring this directory. Either cafile or capath must not
 *                be NULL.
 *  certfile -    path to a file containing the PEM encoded certificate file
 *                for this client. If NULL, keyfile must also be NULL and no
 *                client certificate will be used.
 *  keyfile -     path to a file containing the PEM encoded private key for
 *                this client. If NULL, certfile must also be NULL and no
 *                client certificate will be used.
 *  pw_callback - if keyfile is encrypted, set pw_callback to allow your client
 *                to pass the correct password for decryption. If set to NULL,
 *                the password must be entered on the command line.
 *                Your callback must write the password into "buf", which is
 *                "size" bytes long. The return value must be the length of the
 *                password. "userdata" will be set to the calling mosquitto
 *                instance. The mosquitto userdata member variable can be
 *                retrieved using <mosquitto_userdata>.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS - on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -   if the input parameters were invalid.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM -   if an out of memory condition occurred.
