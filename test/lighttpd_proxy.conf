# A lighttpd config file for proxying Domoticz traffic
#
# Make sure you set the Document-root to your full-path of the Domoticz WWW directory
#
# ALL calls will be proxied to the Domoticz webserver/webservice that is expected to run on port 8080 (No SSL)
# You can start Domoticz for example with the following config
# sudo ./bin/domoticz -www 8080 -wwwroot www -loglevel debug,error -debuglevel webserver
# Adding the 'received' flag (next to the webserver flag) to the debuglevel as well, will produce detailed input header debug info.
#
# Domoticz will show the (web)requests it handles
#
# Start this script from your Domoticz home directory with:
# lighttpd -D -f test/lighttpd.conf
#
# Because lighttpd acts as a proxy, it will add Proxy-headers to the incoming requests when sending these through to Domoticz (visible with debug flags mentioned above)
#
# Now you can access Domoticz on port 8888 (http://localhost:8888)
