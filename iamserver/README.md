# Domoticz Identity and Access Management service

Domoticz has a build-in IAM service that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2.

See the [SECURITY_SETUP.md](../SECURITY_SETUP.md) for more information.

This directory contains (most of) the code and views used by the IAM service.

**NOTE**: the views are included compile time and not served as files by the Domoticz buildin webserver!
